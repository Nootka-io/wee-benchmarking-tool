In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,\u201d Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats\u2019 central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\u201cSpecifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that \u2018there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\n\u201cWith the Democrats\u2019 poll-tested \u2018quid-pro-quo\u2019 and \u2018bribery\u2019 narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,\u201d Grisham said.\n\u201cWe have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate \u2018impeachment\u2019 proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses\u2019 personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was \u2018accurate\u2019 and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to \u2018bribery\u2019 or any other crime,\u201d she added.\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\n\u201cToday's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,\u201d Grisham said.\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\n\u201cFrankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,\u201d Vindman said.\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\u201cI believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,\u201d Williams said.\n\u201cI can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,\u201d she said in response to a question.\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\u201cWe should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,\u201d Volker said.\nDH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\nGET IT\n"}, "55bb6340e3d7dd8632ba45179ae43c39f8ad0cfcecb4719e3b9cf6106ffb70a3": {"articleBody": "Nov 18, 2019\nT-Swift is beefing with The Carlyle Group ... what a time to be alive ...\nStart your day with the Opening Bell powered by The Water Coolest.

Wait, what?\nThe drama began\u00a0earlier this year when Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which already held a stake in Ithaca, is part\u00a0of a growing number of PE shops getting involved in the music industry.\nWhy? Because, capitalism,\u00a0of course.\u00a0You see, owning music catalogs has become an incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks begin circling*\nBack to Taylor!\u00a0It\u2019s her music, so why can\u2019t she sing it?\nIt\u2019s complicated.\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka original recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the American Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to their original recordings. What isn't as common is a\u00a0label\u00a0not allowing an artist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in Swift's case ... most of her music)\u00a0benefits the owner and the artist financially.\nHe said, she said\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The Carlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ... because hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has\u00a0denied Swift\u2019s claims, saying they were \u201cshocking and false.\u201d And Taylor Swift fans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\nThe bottom line ...\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she\u2019ll be re-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher.\u00a0Which versions play on the radio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to Big Machine and The Carlyle Group.\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music Group, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder:\u00a0\"what did we do to deserve this?\"\nWhy Can\u2019t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31 pm CST\n0\nVolkswagen\u2019s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn\u2019t expected until next year, but the automaker isn \u2018t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it\u2019s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe.\nThe MEB\u2019s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is \u2013 at 195-inches \u2013 about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it\u2019s narrower and lower.\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it\u2019s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There\u2019s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph.\nAs for range, in RWD form you\u2019re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle.\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW\u2019s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo.\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they\u2019re eyes opening.\nInside, there\u2019s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there\u2019s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it\u2019ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There\u2019s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW\u2019s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too.\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that\u2019s still cost effective.\nStory Timeline\n"}, "82b6d780c792df78dcfb00484d50c86fbc7f324a9eb5835b7615f028edb9a574": {"articleBody": "Nov. 20, 2019 5:52 AM EST\nUnpredictable Sondland faces questions about Trump, Ukraine\nBy LISA MASCARO, MARY CLARE JALONICK and ERIC TUCKER\nAssociated Press\nAP-US--Trump-Impeachment, 4th Ld-Writethru\nPatrick Semansky, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the most anticipated witness in the impeachment inquiry, is likely to be unpredictable when he faces questions about his evolving accounts of the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and a newly revealed summertime phone call with President Donald Trump.\nView all (23)\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier Trump tapped as his ambassador to the European Union, is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the Republican president\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once \u2014 \u201cI now do recall,\u201d he said, talking to Ukraine about investigations.\nSondland\u2019s appearance at Wednesday morning\u2019s hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions.\nTrump has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction.\nThe envoy is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers of both parties about Trump\u2019s July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the political investigations at the same time as U.S. military aid for the ally was being stalled.\nSondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\nLast week State Department official David Holmes revealed one of those interactions to impeachment investigators, saying he recalled it \u201cvividly.\u201d\nThe political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cellphone and Holmes could hear Trump\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI then heard President Trump ask, quote, \u2018So he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u2019\u201d Holmes testified. \u201cAmbassador Sondland replied that \u2018He\u2019s going to do it,\u2019 adding that President Zelensky will, quote, \u2018do anything you ask him to.\u2019\u201d\nSondland was known for telling others \"he was in charge of Ukraine\" despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, said another witness in the impeachment probe, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill.\n\"And I asked, well, on whose authority?\u201d said Hill, who will testify Thursday. \"And he said, the President.\"\nSondland\u2019s appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including a career Army officer who described Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy as \u201cimproper.\u201d\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman told lawmakers it was his \u201cduty\u201d to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about a July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to \u201cdeliver\u201d before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,\u201d Vindman testified, referring to the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a seat.\nAt the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day\u2019s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Over the weekend, Trump assailed Williams as part of the \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship.\nFormer National Security Council official Timothy Morrison told investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Sondland and a top aide to Zelenskiy. Afterward, Sondland said he had relayed to the Ukrainian that U.S. aid might be freed if the country would announce the investigations, Morrison testified.\nAnother diplomat, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, shifted his own account of the July 10 meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians.\n\u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,\u201d Volker said.\nA series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.\nVolker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani \u201craised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Zeke Miller, Laurie Kellman, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Lolita Baldor and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\nTopics\n"}, "d605bdef2cde7308a9f2fbd1484d4a9c3da0167177245d346da61e455f42208d": {"articleBody": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)\nA muddled view of US-China trade talks once again seems to be weighing on investors.\nThe major Asian market indexes were mixed in early trading Tuesday after CNBC reported that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic.

While not ideal for a service that boasts such a high technical makeup , recent impressions appear that the 30fps lock is at least fairly stable.\nIt\u2019s when the Google Stadia Red Dead Redemption 2 port attempts to run at an ideal 60fps in the Chrome browser where users will run into issues. Preliminary tests by Digital Foundry reveal that the game runs at an unstable performance level.\nThe group state that the two modes are similar to performance and quality modes on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro. While Chromecast users enjoy the game at a reasonably solid 30fps with 4K output, those who play through the Chrome browser will experience an unstable 1080p 60fps.\nInteresting to see Stadia RDR2 capture out there running at an unstable 60fps.

Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\u201cPeople are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,\u201d InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, \u201c2019 is just not as strong as 2018.\u201d\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cThe end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it\u2019s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017.

That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they\u2019re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame.\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try \u2014 both at home and with the help of a professional \u2014 to reduce episodes of binge eating.\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n1. Ditch the diet\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (\n2\n).\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (\n3\n).\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes .\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains , and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.\nSummary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.\n2. Avoid skipping meals\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (\n4\n).\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (\n).\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\nSummary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.\n3. Practice mindfulness\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (\n).\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (\n7\n).\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\nSummary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you\u2019re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.\n4. Stay hydrated\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (\n8\n).\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13\u201317 ounces (375\u2013500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (\n"}, "359fee228518d55b921194561e9ca88e428df81940246f8fac7a75398377daea": {"articleBody": "The First Map of Saturn's Moon Titan Just Revealed Some Tantalising Features\nREUTERS\n19 NOV 2019\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy .\nThe first global geologic map of Titan.

On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)\n\u00a9 Reuters\n"}, "c7e39ac49fa1235f5d50f83bf2444248bd3aa4e6df044377916c812dd109ba23": {"articleBody": "The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but was re-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy .\nSeparately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010.\nWhat did the prosecutors say?\nDeputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to \"discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange\", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said.\n\"The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,\" it added.\nImage copyright EPA\nImage caption Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses\nMs Persson said: \"I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events.\n\"Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.\"\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionJulian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London\nProsecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case.\nOne chapter over, another barely begun\nCaroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nWith the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\nThe Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police.\nNow Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail.\nFrom behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US.\nWhat was the Swedish investigation about?\nAssange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\nHe also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\nWhat has the reaction been?\nThere was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation.\nWikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.\"\nWhat charges does Assange face in the US?\n"}, "e7d77f1869803e24667fa0b985cff27fb4139951a5ffa494bc9ba810df48fb30": {"articleBody": "Tweet\nBlack Friday 2019 is going to be huge for all sorts of different product categories, from 4K TVs and robot vacuums to Instant Pots and more.

Was it a misjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some Belgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled differently to make sure it is always live?

We moved here two years ago and we\u2019re still in awe of the beauty and take advantage of it every chance we can get. When you think of Colorado you probably think of the mountains, but one thing that most people don\u2019t realize is that it\u2019s quite arid.

We always have a baby carrier in the car so for our hike we just had to make a pit stop at\u00a0Walmart for some easy to carry bottled Arrowhead water and healthy snack bars.\nRed was our water boy for this trip. Armed with some ice packs and a portable cooler bag, the Arrowhead water stayed nice and cold while being easy for a teenager to carry on a mountain hike. We use Arrowhead bottled water because their bottles are made from\u00a0BPA-free\u00a0PET plastic.\nReally, have you ever seen anything so gorgeous?\nThis guy learned the importance of staying hydrated very early on. Soon after we moved here we went to a festival and he didn\u2019t take our warnings to keep hydrated seriously and passed out while waiting in line for a ride. Since that day he has never forgotten to make sure he has water at all times when outside, especially in the warmer months.\nEven Dub had his Arrowhead water in a cup while getting a piggyback ride from daddy. Our baby carrier is another must-have here. Even though he isn\u2019t a baby anymore he still loves to ride in his carrier. This allows us to do more hiking than we normally would since we don\u2019t have to worry about him being able to keep up or getting tired.\nWhile we\u2019re at home we still have to stay hydrated and would love to one day purchase a water cooler for the BPA-free\u00a05-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water.

Click to subscribe!\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic .)\nRead More\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\nSearch\n"}, "d0382c0d9573a0a7beb1e649012d04ec7275ac23513ca6ca59e51477b028283c": {"articleBody": "PG&E begins new mass power shutoff over fire danger\nJANIE HAR\nFacebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Reddit Pinterest\n4\n1of4Grass Valley's Dionicio Torres looks at the gas can selection before taking the last 5-gallon gas can on the shelves at B&C Ace Home & Garden Center, in Grass Valley, Calif., Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in preparation of Wednesday's planned public safety power shutdown.

(Elias Funez/The Union via AP)\nPhotos: Crossgates Mall through the years\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. was set to begin shutting off power Wednesday to some 375,000 people in 18 Northern and central California counties as the region faces extreme fire weather that\u2019s lasted since October.\nA virtually rainless fall has left brush bone-dry and forecasts called for low humidity and winds gusting at times to 55 mph (88.5 kph), which might fling tree branches or other debris into power lines, causing sparks that could set catastrophic fires in the region, PG&E officials said.\nOne Napa County reporting station hasn\u2019t seen a measurable drop of rain since mid-September \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since 1905, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist.\nThe northern Sierra Nevada has seen a fraction of an inch of rain in the past two months instead of the usual 5 inches (127 millimeters), he said.\n\u201cThis lack of rain is keeping the threat of fire very real, this late in the season, in many areas,\u201d said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist.\nIronically, the dry weather up north came as Southern California battened the hatches for a brief but fierce bout of rain. A storm system dumped about 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) of rain in the San Diego County area on Tuesday and more was expected Wednesday.\nFlash flood watches were in effect for some communities east of Los Angeles, with storm warnings up for mountain communities.\nVoluntary evacuation warnings were issued for a few communities in an area of Orange and Riverside counties that was burned in a wildfire last year.\nIn the north, however, warnings of extreme fire danger covered a large area.\nCalifornia\u2019s state fire agency placed fire engines and crews in position in some counties and had crews ready to staff aircraft and bulldozers.\nThe planned blackouts will affect counties north of Sacramento, in the northern San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country and Sierra Nevada foothills.\nThe weather should ease by Thursday morning, allowing PG&E to begin restoring power, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E's senior director of emergency preparedness and response.\nThe state\u2019s largest utility decreased the number of people who could be affected from an original estimate of about 660,000 based on updated forecasts and some juggling of its power system. The utility said it will closely monitor the weather and could further reduce that number if it improves.\nThe planned blackout would be the latest in a series of massive outages by the country\u2019s largest utility, including one last month that affected nearly 2.5 million people and outraged local officials and customers who accused the utility of overkill and using blackouts as a crutch because it failed to harden its equipment to withstand fire weather.\nThe outages have been \u201cterribly disruptive\u201d and PG&E is taking steps to avoid them in the future but at the moment, \u201cwe won\u2019t roll the dice on public safety,\u201d company CEO Andy Vesey said.\nMeanwhile, California\u2019s utilities regulators are demanding answers from wireless providers whose equipment failed during the power outages, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without a way to get emergency alerts or make 911 calls.\nThe California Public Utilities Commission holds a public hearing Wednesday with executives from AT&T, Comcast/Xfinity, T-Mobile and others.\nIn a letter calling for the meeting, CPUC President Marybel Batjer said that \u201clack of service is not a mere inconvenience\u2014 it endangers lives.\u201d She said residents do not have the luxury of failed internet or cellphone connections during a wildfire or other disaster.\nPG&E initiated four rounds of planned outages in October.\nMore than 450,000 people were without communication, according to a group representing rural counties in California. About half of Marin County\u2019s cell sites were out of service.\nConsumer advocates are urging the PUC to establish backup power requirements and make the companies provide detailed information about the location of outages.\nThe California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said in an Oct. 26 letter to communications companies that their level of engagement was \u201cunacceptable\u201d at a time when redundant infrastructure is necessary.\nThe utilities commission is frustrated with both communications and utilities companies, saying they failed to share detailed information in real time.\nBusinesses and residents also have complained of poor communications and say that the outages were overly broad and carried out thoughtlessly.\nJANIE HAR\n"}, "f8ff621a0b9b7646cc0d57d37416feabba2bf78ef5dd0bfc5b080f9f97bbe584": {"articleBody": "Home Depot Stock Is Falling After Its Earnings Release.

But its lowered forecast isn\u2019t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street. That\u2019s good news for investors.\nHome Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third quarter . Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share .

Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\u201cOur third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,\u201d said CEO Craig Menear in the company\u2019s news release. \u201cWe are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.\u201d\nOne Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a \u201cseamless, interconnected shopping experience\u201d for customers.\nIn a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results.

I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another HomePod , but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren\u2019t always the right gift.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products , and most of those picks are still applicable.\nBut there\u2019s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I\u2019ve received for testing \u2014 new technology that I\u2019m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I\u2019m grateful for this year.\nSatechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it\u2019s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit while charging in the car.\nSatechi\u2019s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I\u2019ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro \u2014 even during use.\nIt\u2019s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I\u2019m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports , but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\nIt\u2019s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year \u2014 not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\nThanks to new GaN ( gallium nitride ) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\nRAVPower\u2019s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it\u2019s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple\u2019s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable , available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nWhile no one has matched Apple\u2019s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\nMophie\u2019s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It\u2019s not cheap at $140, but it\u2019s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\nPrior to Mophie\u2019s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad\u2019s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie\u2019s personally. If you don\u2019t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\nEven with Apple\u2019s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods , Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn\u2019t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 before you factor the cost of a new TV.\nI\u2019ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year.\u00a0Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we\u2019re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\nIf you\u2019re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\nI\u2019ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop\u00a0Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack .\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn\u2019t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse . I received one for testing alongside the $99 Logitech\u2019s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple\u2019s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple\u2019s standalone Magic Keyboard.\nThen there\u2019s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro and my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I\u2019m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it\u2019s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age \u2014 even after a keyboard repair.\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio . iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven\u2019t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\nIt may not be for me, but it\u2019s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\nLooking for more gift recommendations?

Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures , a large foundation with which we work closely.\nSummary\nThis post will discuss the following:\nWhy Evidence Action Beta is promising. ( More )\nRisks we see with this Incubation Grant. ( More )\nOur plans for following Evidence Action Beta\u2019s work going forward. ( More )\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\nA key part of GiveWell\u2019s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs . GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create \u2026 [an] incubator \u2026 focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, \u2026 our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling \u2026 promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta\u2019s parent organization, Evidence Action , leads two of our top charities ( Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season ) and one standout charity ( Dispensers for Safe Water ).\nModeling cost-effectiveness\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant\u2019s cost-effectiveness.\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\nThis could occur:\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities\u2014in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities\u2019 funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities\u2019 funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn\u2019t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta\u2019s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here .)\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant : note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers , but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nRisks to the success of the grant\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell\u2019s 2017 top charities , or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities , end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\nGoing forward\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n"}, "c4a3637c6696f238cf9fe1c7fbb17bbb6731a71d4f5fe399b9b4fc3294a96a6b": {"articleBody": "\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0439\u0440\u0438\u043c (skyrim) \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\n\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\n\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u00a0player.setav speedmult *\u0445100\nplayer.setav health * .\nplayer.setav magicka *\nplayer.setav stamina *\n\u0422\u043e,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443 \u0412\u0430\u0441 \u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442, \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0418 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0438. \u041c\u044b \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438, \u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f.\n\u0418\u0437 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c\u00a0player.modav speedmult 125, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e, \u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0430 80-70 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 10\n\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c.\n0\n"}, "30b771a40a4e96156d398716c877deef54b05d091770d2717c98e4c6b670010c": {"articleBody": "Tony Carter All , Books , Kit Reviews , News\nTested by: John Milbank RRP: 49.95 Euro (\u00a340) More info: www.earbooks.net/en | +49 (0)40 890 85-433\nIf you want a book that makes you feel great about being a biker, this is it.

While it looks quite familiar, Apple's new flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We've spent the last several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has dutifully listened to users' feedback this time around. Let's talk about it.\nApple's 16-inch MacBook Pro\nWe're not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro within 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.\nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its 16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren't even obvious \u2014 the monitor is about a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can't even tell that the machine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.\nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015 model. You also can't tell unless you're looking at the three together.\nSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube\nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9 configuration \u2014effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or 5500M. For this review, we're examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The retail price on this configuration is $3,299.\n16-inches instead of 15.4\nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won't, and even before you started reading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes, there are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the screen, though.\nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to the 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks better with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density going from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won't be a huge reason for users to upgrade though.\nThe slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one change to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your refresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen from to best align with your work.\nKeyboard\nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if you like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with different key feels because assorted manufacturers believe  that there is that much granularity in demand.\nSo, a little context is important. We're not giant fans of typing on glass, like the iPad. We didn't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was introduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro \u2014 but it wasn't a favorite of ours.\nInverted 'T' design for arrow keys\nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are polarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of keyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the \"it'll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this is great\" zone.\nIn regards to reliability, across the entire AppleInsider staff, exactly one unit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through 2015 keyboard. And, the data we've been collecting on the 2018 model and the mid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working, with it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012 through 2015 design.\nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is punctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any other, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key bottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is on the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the clackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you'll never mistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.\nThere's more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this piece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro keyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7 millimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on the 2012 through 2015 style.\nTyping on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a Kanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance. Typing on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about 43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a particularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.\nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an underpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than the 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the 2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro \u2014 and this is a good thing.\nAnd, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn't get any information on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a complete disassembly is required to do so.\nTouch Bar and Escape Key\nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and instead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its own little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that Apple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.\nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference \u2014 but for coders, it's an entirely different story. We've been told about times where things have gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn't work at all, forcing a hard reboot.\nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial impression. we've adopted it into our workflows. We're not going to say that everybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a frontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a Touch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-mandated uses.\nTesting the silicon\nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks to its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the chips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw that single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores increased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.\nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the machine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.\nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app performance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous generation clocked in at a 126.8.\nGPU\nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark. Running at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium quality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6 frames per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames per second.\nUnigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which earned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average FPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the previous high-end selection.\nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5 Compute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base garnered only a 13919.\nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro X project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated  The previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated machine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.\nThermals\nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds up, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.\nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.\nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard's metal surface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys. That's still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while running under load.\nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We'll be looking a lot more at varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and machine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any difference at all to performance.\nBut, we're not expecting to see much difference this time around.\nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook Pro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging surfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.\nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook Pro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the keyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with equivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.\nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It's hard to describe how it sounds now, but there's a lower pitch and a different warble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You'll notice the difference if you're a long-time user, but it isn't distracting, and you'll forget the old sound pretty quickly.\nUsing Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\nWe've only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing suggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for longer \u2014 which isn't well-reflected in benchmark testing to date.\nThe fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office environment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on observation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C \u2014 earlier than the 80C that the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We'll be testing this more in the future.\nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will vary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility that turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a silent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a half times longer to complete your job. We'll be talking about this in the future too.\nFlash speeds are still blistering\nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test after the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890 megabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a 512GB and 1TB model.\nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about 350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or more.\nBattery life\nBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-up internals. That new battery doesn't just match the last model's performance, it extends it. While we didn't have too much of a chance to surf the web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect \u2014 which is one hour more than the 15-inch offered.\nSpeakers\nWe didn't expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them out we were wowed.\nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and headphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening to content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.\nThere are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it doesn't cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.\nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we listening to content from one machine to the other.\nWi-Fi 6\nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is still capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need to hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with the most recent iPhone launch.\nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest Wi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it for several years and investing in a new machine shouldn't be capped by previous standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with millions of iPhones.\nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the market so looking at today's landscape users aren't missing out, but they will when they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more widely adopted.\nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with Wi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind with the new MacBook Pro in that regard.\nStill four Thunderbolt 3\nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI port has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It's past time to come to terms and deal with it.\nStill four Thunderbolt 3 ports\nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but it is an adjustment for users, if you're coming from a 2015 or older MacBook Pro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this is more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is better made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions.\nWe've said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to connect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol explicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you prefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral cable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.\nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of USB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You can get there from here, and it isn't expensive to do so.\n16-inch MacBook Pro\nLike we've been saying for nearly four years now, if you're hell-bent on sticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C end is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock . Thunderbolt 3 docks start at $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if you don't need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol allows.\nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and GPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to the tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there was no drain at all.\nIf you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook Pro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that unit to the new machine. It won't supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W adapter that your machine came with will.\nFurthermore, if you're considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures have USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a dock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along with a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we've seen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be rectified very soon.\nRegarding MagSafe, we've been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this point, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood desk surface, the force required to pull out Apple's USB-C charging cable is about three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when the cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the horizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical.\nThe 96W USB-C power adapter\nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force, so now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or inadvertent pull.\nApple's service numbers that we've collated bear out that the removal of official MagSafe hasn't caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe's introduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009. There was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years since the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the accidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.\nWith a 11-hour battery, we're not sure why you'd want to string a power cord along a transit route anyway. If you're that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD battery and keep it next to your computer.\nIf you're still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options on Amazon.\nThe MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It isn't even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and it is very, very fast.\nIf you're doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work better for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro is in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn't have those seemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn't really portable either, even if you spring for the wheels.\nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid machine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made, if not by a lot.\nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job, constantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren't constantly pushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we've said time and time again, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the time is crucial in making this decision.\nEditing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nIf you're coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is unquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly every task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones, the i9 performance isn't supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\" model.\nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of computer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines with the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running Windows.\nHow much is macOS worth to you?

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\nI know \u2014 it all looks so good. But you can\u2019t eat it all, so it\u2019s time to set priorities.\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks \u2014 those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you\u2019re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\nAnd you don\u2019t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can\u2019t live without and leave it at that.\n2. Don\u2019t forget to drink water\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you\u2019re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they\u2019re there.\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we\u2019re feeling especially hungry.\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\nThat\u2019s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there \u2014 and without realizing it, we\u2019ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you\u2019re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don\u2019t overdo it.\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don\u2019t let your fingers do the walking.\n4. \u201cVeggie-fy\u201d your chips \u2018n\u2019 dip\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\nBecause let\u2019s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it\u2019s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips .\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\nAnd don\u2019t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip \u2014 those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\nHealthy Game Day Dip:\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you\u2019ll get plenty of tangy crunch \u2014 without all the calories.\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you\u2019re saving nearly 100 calories \u2014 about the same as a bottle of light beer.\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s why I always tell my clients: \u201can open face is a happy face!\u201d\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you\u2019re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks \u2014 without overdoing it!\nGet started with 2B Mindset here.\nRelated Articles\n"}, "dc7ccccc1f34eb2928cb238739aaf18c712d59d8d34b41acfb29178aeba65356": {"articleBody": "Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\nSweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:50 GMT\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (AFP)\nHighlights\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden\u2019s attorney general.\nSweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.\n\u201cAfter conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the course of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,\u201d Sweden\u2019s deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on Tuesday.\nPersson explained that the complainant\u2019s evidence had initially been deemed credible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made clear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened, primarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses\u2019 memories had faded for natural reasons.\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of Sweden\u2019s attorney general.\nAssange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\nFollowing Assange\u2019s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Press TV.

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure of American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to influence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants sabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of the humanitarian convoy\u2019s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened families wishing to leave the camp.\u201d\nFalse\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria\u2019s al-Tanf of controlling \u201cbandit formations\u201d and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as \u201cpatently false,\u201d and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\nThe al-Tanf base\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer \u201cde-confliction zone\u201d on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established .\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\nThe Rukban camp\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm , is located in the desert near Syria\u2019s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country\u2019s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan\u2019s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\u201cU.S.-controlled bandit formations\u201d\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT \u2013 formerly the Free Syrian Army \u2013 to fight against Islamic State.\nOmar Lamrani , a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University\u2019s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s allegations are false.\n\u201cI can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not \u2018control\u2019 any actors there directly,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cFrom my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp\u201d\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u2019s claim is \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d\n\u201cNot the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,\u201d the source said. \u201cMany people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.\u201d\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry\u2019s claim \u201cis patently false,\u201d and that \u201cthe United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.\u201d\n\u201cRukban is another example of the Assad regime\u2019s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,\u201d Robertson said.\nHe added: \u201cThe (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.\u201d\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is \u201cworking in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.\u201d\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution .\n\u201cAlthough Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cThis is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.\u201d\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: \u201cThe United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.\u201d\nMost popular\n"}, "11ea381ad92b5448cf66eae62f52ac565361a244c8881615fc6a7bb523cc0c32": {"articleBody": "ATEN\u00c7\u00c3O: Coment\u00e1rios com textos inintelig\u00edveis ou que faltem com respeito ao usu\u00e1rio n\u00e3o ser\u00e3o aprovados pelo moderador.\n\u00bb Coluna de Adauto Silva\nClique na foto do Adauto e veja as colunas sobre Formula 1, MotoGP e outras que ele escreve para o Autoracing!\n\u00daltima coluna: F1 \u2013 Max Verstappen \u00e9 um animal\n\u00bb Publicidade\n\u00bb Autoracing Power Ranking\nClique na imagem acima e veja como est\u00e1 o ranking dos pilotos nesta temporada da F1 no GP do Brasil e no Geral de 2019.\n\u00bb Preview Autoracing \u2013 GP do Brasil 2019\nClique e saiba os hor\u00e1rios da TV do GP do Brasil, o 20\u00ba da temporada 2019.

My fears have been realized.\"\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\nVolker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.\n3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\nVolker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at \"three amigos\" references\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"\n4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 Morrison's supervisor \u2014 to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\nVolker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\n6. \"The Gordon problem\"\nTim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n7. \"The Giuliani problem\"\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt.

(credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\nSeeking a bigger role for a big rocket\nby Jeff Foust\nMonday, November 18, 2019\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket\u2019s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a \u201cGreen Run\u201d test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\u201cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,\u201d Cooke said.\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA\u2019s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn\u2019t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration\u2019s own party in Congress. \u201cEvery space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee\u2019s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA\u2019s exploration plans.\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA\u2019s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\u201cWhile I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,\u201d he continued.\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA\u2019s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA\u2019s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. \u201cThe fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,\u201d said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke\u2019s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a big booster, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\u201cSLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.\u201d He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit\u2014no Gateway required.\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\u201cThe mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,\u201d Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke\u2019s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. \u201cI cannot disagree with it.\u201d\n\u201cBut with eight launches, I\u2019ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,\u201d he concluded.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Lucas responded with a sigh.\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a big booster, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don\u2019t have it, you\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d\nYoung, in his testimony, didn\u2019t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called \u201cexperiments\u201d in procurement. \u201cManaging and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,\u201d he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\u201cA management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.\u201d\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. \u201cThe plate is really full today,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.\u201d\nOne thing Young would push off NASA\u2019s plate is the Gateway. \u201cI do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,\u201d he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. \u201cThere\u2019s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.\u201d\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. \u201cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\u2014I\u2019m not confident that could happen.\u201d\nLast week\u2019s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA\u2019s use\u2014or unwillingness to use\u2014the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\u201cI understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,\u201d he said, including the first Block 1B. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cIt depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,\u201d responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn\u2019t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we\u2019re guaranteed the second core we\u2019d need for a Moon landing in 2024,\u201d added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. \u201cAdding an additional SLS into the mix could\u2014I\u2019m not confident that could happen.\u201d\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. \u201cWhat commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?\u201d\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman\u2019s OmegA.\n\u201cThere could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,\u201d Bridenstine added. \u201cWe\u2019re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,\u201d Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles\u2014or SLS.\n\u201cBut if commercial\u2019s not available, what\u2019s the contingency plan?\u201d Aderholt asked again.\n\u201cI think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the additional rockets, then we\u2019re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll have those rockets.\u201d\n\u201cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\u201d Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke\u2019s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we\u2019ll assess their approaches.\u201d\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\u201cUsing the lift capability of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a \u2018Fewest Steps to the Moon\u2019 approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,\u201d Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the \u201cnational team\u201d led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\nNASA\u2019s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don\u2019t know the costs down the road,\u201d Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, \u201cin order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\u201d\nBabin referred to those comments at last week\u2019s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were \u201ddwindling.\u201d\n\u201cIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.\u201d\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA\u2019s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\nJeff Foust ( jeff@thespacereview.com ) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews .

Since Diwali, despite the Supreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the monitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become a standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower surface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the National Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social media about an \u2018oxygen bar\u2019!\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about this unique \u2018bar\u2019. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone who is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we have an oxygen bar in Delhi?\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and landed up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi\u2019s Saket area that offers this unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is \u2018Oxy Pure\u2019. \u201cAn Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched with an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air pollutants in a cost-effective manner,\u201d the description on the website reads.\nOffering \u2018rejuvenating\u2019 experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, \u201cconsists of an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating customers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula along with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you with more vigour and energy.\u201d\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and Margarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas and decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299 for fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to visit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right now is 218, which is in \u2018poor\u2019 category.\nFirst Published: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 08:38 AM\nRelated Tags:\n"}, "5fbc7ccb504c755ae23a85499a17518483d7862b74b4a5c34d86ede1a1a4448e": {"articleBody": "ZDNet Japan\nBest tech gadgets of 2019\nAirPods Pro. Sonos Move. Galaxy Note 10. See what else made our list for best tech gadgets of the past year.\nRead More\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we saw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple impresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech companies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along with the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to keep on an eye out for the best deals.\nSome of 2019's best tech gadgets\nDisclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\nApple AirPods Pro for $235\nSee it now: Amazon\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been asking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple finally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new design sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments, and comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\nNintendo\nNintendo Switch Lite for $200\nSee it now: Amazon\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into a dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The screen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently attached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch that users love and embrace.\nSonos\nSonos Move for $400\nSee it now: Amazon\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment speakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable. With Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest of its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\nAmazon\nAmazon Echo Buds for $130\nSee it now: Amazon\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have been well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds have Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and Android devices.\nApple iPhone 11 Pro.\nApple iPhone 11 Pro Max\u00a0for $999\nSee it now: Apple\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what it did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an amazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that battery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get this year.\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\nSee it now: Samsung\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed, has a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep up with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your creativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\nDJI\nDJI Mavic Mini for $399\nSee it now: Amazon\nThe Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package. With a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to believe it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and enthusiasts who love shiny new things.\nFossil\nFossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\nSee it now: Fossil\nThe Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a normal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient display that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your connected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\nWyze\nWyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\nSee it now: Wyze\nKnow when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway with the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to connect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\nAmazon\nAmazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\nSee it now: Amazon\nOne of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The new Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to the side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control connected devices, ask questions or play music.\nRing\nRing Indoor Cam for $60\nSee it now: Amazon\nRing security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been made primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and capable of helping you monitor your home.\nLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into a shortlist is hard. Really hard. Surely, we left some of your favorite gadgets off of this list.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got a good evaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel concerned that it may just create noise that doesn\u2019t actually drive the behaviors that they\u2019re looking to drive.\u201d\nWhen developing the \u201cStarts with one\u201d campaign \u2013 which will be in its third year in January \u2013 DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences,  working with them  directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values regarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior is much more difficult, Hege said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to change people\u2019s behaviors, but this is also some of the most important advertising and communications work that\u2019s out there,\u201d Hege said. \u201cThis is our favorite kind of work to do because it\u2019s a way to make a positive impact in the world.\u201d\nWhile the  \u201cMeth. We\u2019re on it.\u201d campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n\u201cWhen a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that\u2019s not intended to see it,\u201d Graham said.\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n\u201cYou might need to have a message that\u2019s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, \u2018Wow this is a little over the edge\u2019 or they might think, \u2018Why are they putting it here?\u2019 It\u2019s because it\u2019s meant for a specific population.\u201d\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent  domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\u201cWe were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that\u2019s where a lot of young men were spending more time,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt can seem like there\u2019s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.\u201d\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought  South Dakota\u2019s campaign \u2013 run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 \u2013 was meant to raise eyebrows.\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company\u2019s kitchen, where he  posts new marketing findings and other things for  members of his firm to ponder.\n\u201cOK, great, let\u2019s be provocative, let\u2019s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don\u2019t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cWhat\u2019s America talking about? South Dakota\u2019s got a meth problem, so that\u2019s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.\u201d\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and \u201cwe want to try to help,\u201d Sanborn said.\n\u201cThe problem is, we tell clients all the time, they\u2019ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.\u201d\nWordcount: 717\nPublished: Nov. 19, 2019, 6:18 p.m.\nUpdated: Nov. 19, 2019, 7:10 p.m.\nSubscribe to the Morning Review newsletter\nGet the day\u2019s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by subscribing to our newsletter.\nYou have been successfully subscribed!\nThere was a problem subscribing you to the newsletter.

qualifying is over. Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying finished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's tournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for Ryan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the semifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro 2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA Nations League.\nHere's what to know:\nThere's still a chance for these teams\nAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a spot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each path having one berth:\nPath A: Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath B: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland\nPath C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath D: Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus\n*A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.\nClinching in November\nOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at Ireland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before, Portugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and Cristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one shot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories out of eight in all competitions.\nCroatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia secured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout of Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern Ireland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\nOn Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against Liechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\nAnd earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot, and that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with the reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites.

First it was hard to breathe, then dizzy spells caused by any amount of exertion.\n\"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out,\" wrote 43-year-old Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in a case study published Monday in the journal BMJ.\n\"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 minute activity, as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" Taylor added.\nFour doctor appointments failed to find the cause, which was \"extremely distressing,\" wrote Taylor, who had never smoked. With his health failing, he stayed home from work and spent most of his days and nights asleep.\nTaylor didn't know at the time that he was suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease in which lungs become inflamed as the result of an allergic reaction. Caught early, the disease is easily treatable. Undiagnosed, it can lead to permanent lung scarring, and even death.\nUnfortunately, in Taylor's case, the doctors he first saw had no clue as to the cause.\nTime for Dr. Sherlock\nAt first Taylor was treated for an upper respiratory infection. But his health continued to decline over the next three months. Then a radiologist dismissed a chest X-ray of his lungs as normal.\nConcerned, his family doctor put in a call to the urgent respiratory clinic and spoke to Dr. Owen John Dempsey, a consultant chest physician at BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen, Scotland, about a 30-minute drive from Aberdeenshire.\n\"His general practitioner was very astute in not accepting the chest X-ray result at face value,\" Dempsey said, adding that it can be difficult to diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis because the changes are often subtle with just a \"slight diffuse greyness to the lungs.\"\n\"I think the radiologist may have thought it was just a slightly 'under-exposed' chest X-ray,\" Dempsey said.\nDempsey picked up the phone and rang Taylor.\n\"He sounded very breathless, having just walked from one room in his house to the other,\" Dempsey said. \"Very abnormal for such a young man. It was clear the patient had progressive and really very disabling breathlessness, now interfering with activities of daily life.\"\nMaking the diagnosis was \"a bit like a jigsaw,\" Dempsey said. One of the first clues was Taylor's blood work, which showed his immune system was exposed to avian protein. However, Taylor told Dempsey he didn't own any birds, just a cat and dog.\n\"I have a particular interest in this group of diseases,\" Dempsey said. \"And we know that if you take a meticulous history, you can often identify triggers in the environment for lung diseases.\"\nDempsey dove deeper: Taylor lived in a warm, dry house with his wife. They had a loft, which he didn't visit much, but they did have an en-suite bathroom with a bit of mold above the shower and window. He hadn't traveled to a foreign area. He had no drug history. He worked in an office with no obvious exposures. And he played guitar and saxophone in a local band.\n\"We are paid to be nosy,\" Dempsey said. \"The danger is that we don't ask enough and assume diseases are 'idiopathic' or unexplained. If so, we miss a trick and our patients are subjected to unnecessary tests or treatments.\"\nFinally, Dempsey's questions hit pay dirt: The couple had recently replaced their synthetic bedding with a feather duvet and feather pillows. Taylor had Feather Duvet Lung disease.\nAs Sherlock would say, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"\nFeather Duvet Lung disease\nBird allergies are not uncommon. Often called bird fancier's asthma, symptoms can range from a wheezy cough, runny nose and eye irritation to asthma to more serious complications such as Taylor's. People with allergies are most at risk when bird cages or lofts are cleaned out, and during the time of year when birds molt and shed their feathers.\nFeather Duvet Lung disease is a subset of bird fancier's asthma, and it's difficult to diagnose because of its rarity and the wide variety in timing and type of symptoms.\nOnset of symptoms following exposure to new feather duvets or pillows can range from three weeks to five years. Difficulty in breathing can grow over time, and the patient can have night sweats, dry cough, weight loss and fever. The condition is often misdiagnosed if the person reports no birds in the home, and many doctors don't think to ask about bedding.\n\"Most doctors, in my experience, don't ask that level of detail,\" Dempsey said, adding that doctors should always ask about exposures at home, including bedding, molds, the warmth and dryness of the home, and any unusual hobbies or pastimes.\nEarly recognition of avian antigen exposure and removal of the bedding or other irritant is critical to recovery for patients, Dempsey stressed.\nSuccessful treatment\nWhile studies have not always supported the use of steroids, in this situation they were successful, especially since Taylor also removed the feather bedding.\n\"The steroids which were prescribed after diagnosis ... had a transformative effect within two days,\" Taylor wrote. \"The course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely.\n\"I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\"\n\u00a9 Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland\n"}, "87bf60570e6e2e33cb1f0fdb5600d6c85012e60be25ba6fa587b8f90eb9a3770": {"articleBody": "Sen.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier . Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline \u2014 the largest international carrier in the world \u2014 will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production . Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\nRelated Tags\n"}, "c69e539d689a8335a69042727f1b58edab09d5d99fb607ec625a63151a537dc2": {"articleBody": "Ascom and Dr\u00e4ger introduce integrated clinical alarm management solution in North America to improve patient care\nAugust 23, 2018\nThe full integration of Ascom Unite Connect for clinical systems with Dr\u00e4ger Infinity patient monitoring systems will deliver mobile alert message notifications, customized alarm filtering, and waveform images.\nBAAR, SWITZERLAND\nAscom , a global solutions provider focused on healthcare ICT and mobile workflow solutions, announced a new North American integrated clinical alarm management solution with Dr\u00e4ger, a global producer of medical and safety technology, to integrate Ascom Unite Connect for clinical systems software with Dr\u00e4ger Infinity patient monitoring systems. Ascom\u2019s Unite Connect for clinical systems recently received FDA clearance for sales and distribution in the US. It is also available in Canada.\nThe joint clinical alarm management solution extends the reach of patient alarms generated by Dr\u00e4ger\u2019s patient monitoring system to mobile caregivers. The alert message provides critical data and related contextual information right to the caregiver\u2019s mobile device. The mobile delivery of waveform images adds a contextual dimension by helping increase awareness of the patient\u2019s condition and helping nurses distinguish between artifacts, false alarms, and real alarms. Patients benefit from quicker response times to events.\nAlready in use at European hospitals in France, Belgium and Norway, Ascom\u2019s Unite Connect for clinical systems is a software application utilizing customizable alarm filters to help minimize non-actionable alerts which can cause workflow bottlenecks. Nurses can then focus more effectively on patient care rather than responding to alerts that do not require action. These alert notification messages are intended as a secondary notification system to inform caregivers of patient events captured by these clinical systems and do not replace the primary alarm functions on the monitors.\nSteve Menet, Senior Vice President of Sales for Dr\u00e4ger, Inc., says: \u201cEffective clinical alarm management continues to be a high focus for health systems and hospitals. As the use of mobile technologies expands in healthcare, so does the opportunity to extend alarm management to mobile caregivers. Our new solution with Ascom provides customers the opportunity to communicate actionable patient information from our Infinity patient monitoring systems to clinicians, while filtering out nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm fatigue.\u201d\nRob Goldman, President Ascom North America, says: \u201cBy collaborating with Dr\u00e4ger, Ascom can help hospitals supplement and enhance their alarm management solutions. Leveraging Unite Connect for clinical systems\u2019 customizable alarm filtering helps mobile caregivers avoid unnecessary work interruptions, limiting their exposure to low-priority, routine alerts and helping reduce caregiver alarm fatigue.\u201d\nAscom is a global solutions provider focused on healthcare ICT and mobile workflow solutions. The vision of Ascom is to close digital information gaps allowing for the best possible decisions \u2013 anytime and anywhere. Ascom\u2019s mission is to provide mission-critical, real-time solutions for highly mobile, ad hoc, and time-sensitive environments.

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the \u201cnew Gannett,\u201d as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.\nSince 2008, there hasn\u2019t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole.\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don\u2019t much care for.\n\u201cSince 2008, there hasn\u2019t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,\u201d says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That\u2019s produced a strategy of \u201ccontinuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.\u201d The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in \u201csynergies\u201d from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce.

McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company\u2019s news assets.\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn\u2019t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government\u2019s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\nMcClatchy\u2019s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune\u2019s largest shareholder.\n"}, "20b2b64916b00b25203c9f1bf14248922f4d522f18328e9f876cce116df0083e": {"articleBody": "Film\n23 Nov 2017\nIl black Friday incombe su di noi: per chi non lo sapesse (o per chi \u00e8 sbarcato da Marte recentemente) il \u201cvenerd\u00ec nero\u201d \u00e8 l\u2019ennesima consuetudine importata dagli USA dove, il venerd\u00ec dopo il Giorno del Ringraziamento, i negozi offrono super sconti per lo shopping di Natale.\nSi tratta di una tradizione consolidatasi negli anni Sessanta: i negozianti americani propongono sconti speciali allo scopo di favorire lo shopping e dare il via alle spese natalizie.\nNegli ultimi anni, per favorire oltremodo i consumi, il Black Friday si \u00e8 trasformato nella settima del Black Friday, con sconti e offerte speciali che si trascinano lungo tutta la settimana precedente.\nE chi siamo noi per astenersi da questa corsa consumistica?

The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is \u201cabsolutely no room for compromise\u201d. But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police , who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message \u2013 no way out \u2013 was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched \u201csave the students\u201d marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong\u2019s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People\u2019s Liberation Army took to the city\u2019s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a \u201cvoluntary clean-up activity\u201d which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\nThe movement\u2019s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to \u201cshow absolutely no mercy\u201d in the \u201cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u201d. Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the \u201cBelfastisation\u201d of the city.\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing\u2019s chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan\u2019s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year\u2019s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\nChina\u2019s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible \u2013 but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain . Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\nTopics\n"}, "51d066b0602c9421d8d6410bc4b931700978409a3faa2a984e8fbde519ad7241": {"articleBody": "Now that his federal trial has ended, federal prosecutors in Texas released the body camera footage when officers found and rescued her from a Forest Hill hotel room and arrested Webb.\nA family friend found the suspect's car in the hotel parking lot and called 911.\nThe video shows officers racing up a staircase, converging outside the suspect's room and banging on the door.\n\"Fort Worth P.D.

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth \u2013 reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.\nrelated news\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\nNear-term consolidation likely\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally.

( STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY)\nsmithsonian.com\nNovember 18, 2019\nThree cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low.\nAs Emily Feng reports for NPR , the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague , one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis\u2014the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO , is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times . All \u201crelevant sites\u201d were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo , a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were \u201cextremely low.\u201d\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post , killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\nThe Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague\u2014like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters .\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death , which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe\u2019s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China , spreading to the West via ships . Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO , there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years\u201426 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR\u2019s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3\u2014nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be \u201ctransmitted casually.\u201d But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to \u201cblock and control\u201d discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n\u201cDon't hide things like this,\u201d one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. \u201cLet\u2019s face whatever it is together.\u201d\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China\u2019s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country\u2019s SARS outbreak\u2014and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China \u201cvastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,\u201d writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is \u201cno need\u201d for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country\u2014like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau\u2014are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.\nLike this article?\nPrivacy Policy , Terms of Use\nAbout Brigit Katz\nBrigit Katz is a freelance writer based in Toronto.

September 2018\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) \u2013 der lange Marsch ins Digitale Gesundheitswesen\nDie Digitalisierung als Wachstums- und Entwicklungstreiber zieht sich bereits heute durch fast alle Branchen und Anwendungsgebiete, sei es im Finanzbereich, der Industrie oder eben auch im Bereich Healthcare. Auch wenn nicht jedes Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell von Disruption bzw. Digital Darwinismus bedroht ist, bieten neue Technologien Potenziale f\u00fcr mehr Effizienz, bessere Prozesse und zur Kostenersparnis.\nIm Bereich der Gesundheitsversorgung in Krankenh\u00e4usern ist dieser Aspekt ein besonders wichtiger. Durch die Festlegung von Fallpauschalen und Sonderentgelten besteht ein hoher Kostendruck. Der Bedarf an mehr Effizienz durch Digitalisierung bleibt nicht nur w\u00fcnschenswert, er ist zwingend notwendig. Damit das gelingt, ist der Einsatz von geeigneten interoperablen L\u00f6sungen entscheidend.\nDas Thema mit dem h\u00f6chsten Potenzial aber auch mit den meisten Hindernissen wird seit Jahren intensiv diskutiert: Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA)\nStatus Quo\nAnaloge Prozesse\nIn Deutschland liegen Patientendaten in internen Systemen vor \u2013 Sei es in Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) oder im Praxisverwaltungssystem (PVS) niedergelassener \u00c4rzte. Auch die Dokumentation von weiteren Befunden ist in der Regel ein manueller Vorgang. Zwischen einzelnen Leistungserbringern werden Patienteninformationen, Befunde, R\u00f6ntgenbilder teils digital, z.B. durch einrichtungsinterne Informationssysteme, aber auch analog in Form der Fieberkurve in der Behandlungskette weitergereicht. Handschriftliche Dokumentationen und postalischer Versand und Empfang sind fehleranf\u00e4llig. Behandelnde Mediziner sind dabei nicht immer auf dem aktuellsten Stand, erhalten wichtige Patientendaten gar nicht oder zu sp\u00e4t und m\u00fcssen Zeit f\u00fcr die Konsultation mit Kollegen aufwenden. Langwierige Behandlungszeitr\u00e4ume aber auch doppelt gef\u00fchrte oder unvollst\u00e4ndige Patientenakten sind die Folge. Durch unn\u00f6tige \u00dcberbehandlung und Dokumentation sowie Behandlungsfehler entstehen so j\u00e4hrlich Kosten in Milliardenh\u00f6he.\nEinrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Intransparenzen\nAufgrund des medizinischen Fortschritts sind Behandlungszentren und Einrichtungen aber auch die einzelnen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen hochdifferenziert. Je nach Diagnose und Krankheitsbild werden Untersuchungen und Therapien f\u00fcr Patienten in arbeitsteiligen, teils parallel ablaufenden Prozessen und \u00fcber mehrere Fachkliniken, Fachbereiche und Akteure abgebildet. Die so entstehenden Versorgungsketten sind zwischen den Einrichtungen nur lose bis gar nicht verzahnt, so dass es zu Br\u00fcchen in der Informationskette und Intransparenzen kommt. Das unzureichende oder fehlende Wissen \u00fcber den aktuellen Behandlungs- und Gesundheitsstatus eines Patienten erschwert die weitere Behandlung und wirkt sich negativ auf die Patientensicherheit und die Kosteneffizenz der Leistungserbringer aus. Durch fehlende Interoperabilit\u00e4t zwischen den unterschiedlichen Informationssystemen sind Gesundheitseinrichtungen, \u00c4rzte und Patienten digital voneinander entkoppelt.\nDer Patient als Informationsquelle und -Verteiler\nDurch die fehlende Synchronisation von Patientendaten zwischen verschiedenen Einrichtungen in der Versorgungskette kommt dem Patienten eine besondere Rolle als Informations\u00fcbermittler zu. Einerseits muss er m\u00f6glichst l\u00fcckenlos \u00fcber seine bisherige Krankengeschichte (je nach Fall \u00fcber mehrere Jahre in die Vergangenheit) berichten k\u00f6nnen aber auch medizinisches Fachpersonal hinsichtlich bestehender Vorerkrankungen, Medikation, Unvertr\u00e4glichkeiten, Allergien, etc. aufkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnen. Gerade bei \u00e4lteren oder geistig beeintr\u00e4chtigten Patienten sind Informationsl\u00fccken oft unvermeidlich. Zus\u00e4tzlich werden Dokumente wie Arztbriefe oder Ergebnisse aus bildgebenden Verfahren dem Patienten bei der Entlassung/\u00dcberstellung pers\u00f6nlich mitgegeben. Damit tr\u00e4gt der Patient auch selbst ein unn\u00f6tig hohes Ma\u00df an Verantwortung f\u00fcr einen optimalen Behandlungsverlauf und dessen Dauer.\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) soll diesen Herausforderungen begegnen und bildet aktuell das Kernthema in deutschen Krankenh\u00e4usern und Pflegeeinrichtungen in puncto Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens.\nDie elektronische Patientenakte \u2013 viele Modelle und kaum Vernetzung\nAktuelle Situation\nBereits 2004 mit dem GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz wurde die ePA als eine der Anwendungen der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte (eGK) genannt. Seit dem wurde mehr als eine Milliarde Euro in das Projekt investiert und noch immer nutzen Patienten in Deutschland keine elektronische Gesundheitskarte.\nIn dem 2015 verabschiedeten E-Health-Gesetz wurde die ePA als wesentlicher Teil der k\u00fcnftigen Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) genannt. Die TI, welche von der Betriebsgesellschaft gematik entwickelt wird, soll dabei das digitale Kommunikationsnetz und die Grundlage f\u00fcr die ePA und das elektronische Patientenfach bilden. Bis zum 01.01.2019 sollen alle \u00c4rzte, Psychotherapeuten, Krankenh\u00e4user und anderen Akteure des Gesundheitswesens daran angebunden sein.\nLaut Gesetz soll die ePA den Not\u00adfall\u00addaten\u00adsatz, den Medikationsplan, Arztbriefe und weitere medizinische Dokumente, wie etwa den elektronischen Impfpass, aufnehmen.\nAnders als das ebenfalls vorgesehene ePF, erfordert die ePA als Zugriffsberechtigung den elektronischen Heilberufsausweis des behandelnden Arztes. Im ePF wiederrum sollen dem Versicherten die Inhalte seiner Patientenakte in ein sogenanntes Patientenfach gespiegelt werden, damit der Patient auch unabh\u00e4ngig von einem Arztbesuch darauf zugreifen kann. \u00dcber die Daten der Akte hinaus, soll der Patient hier auch die M\u00f6glichkeit erhalten, pers\u00f6nliche Gesundheitsdaten einzutragen.\nMit einheitlichen Standards und Spezifikationen sollen Insell\u00f6sungen vermieden werden. Im E-Health Gesetz ist davon allerdings nichts zu lesen. Daf\u00fcr existierten heute bereits parallel verschiedene gesetzliche Grundlagen zur Umsetzung von elektronischen Akten:\nIn \u00a7 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 4 SGB V - elektronische Patientenakte\nin \u00a7 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 5 SGB V - elektronisches Patientenfach\nin \u00a7 68 SGB V - elektronische Gesundheitsakte\nin \u00a7 630f BGB \u2013 elektronische Arztakte\nMilliardenschwere Digitalprojekte auf Basis von confusion-by-design haben es schwer. Daher ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass bereits ein E-Health Gesetz II in Arbeit ist. In der Zwischenzeit haben bereits einige Versicherer Ihre eigenen Pilotprojekte in Betrieb genommen. Nat\u00fcrlich mit unterschiedliche Strategien und mit unterschiedlichen Varianten der elektronischen Patientenakte.\nVarianten von Patientenakten\nEinrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Patientenakte (eEPA)\nBei diesem Konzept werden alle Informationen die bei der Behandlungen eines Patienten anfallen f\u00fcr Gesundheitsversorgungseinrichtungen fall\u00fcbergreifend hinweg bereitgestellt. Eintragungen erfolgen ausschlie\u00dflich \u00fcber \u00c4rzte und \u00e4hnliche Behandlungsmitglieder. Die Akte wird dauerhaft gef\u00fchrt, so dass eine gesamtheitliche Versorgung des Patienten \u00fcber alle bisherigen oder bestehenden Krankheiten m\u00f6glich ist. Eintr\u00e4ge k\u00f6nnen von Leistungserbringern \u00fcber ein Portal oder \u00fcber das Prim\u00e4rsystem heraus an die eEPA \u00fcbermittelt werden \u2013 Die Interoperabilit\u00e4t zwischen den Systemen vorausgesetzt. Die eEPA sieht abseits von der Datenfreigabe keine Einsicht oder Mitwirkung durch den Patienten selbst vor.\nElektronische Fallakte (eFA)\nDie eFA ist \u00e4rztlich gef\u00fchrt und moderiert. Sie wird einrichtungs\u00fcbergreifend eingesetzt und ausschlie\u00dflich fallbezogen gef\u00fchrt. Die eFA hat zum Ziel, eine optimale Koordination der Versorgung in den einzelnen Behandlungseinrichtungen zu erm\u00f6glichen. Im Gegensatz zur eEPA wird sie nach Fallabschluss geschlossen, der Lebenszyklus der Akte f\u00e4llt dementsprechend kurz aus. Die Daten in der eFA werden \u00fcber die Prim\u00e4rsysteme zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. Auch hier gibt der Patient seine Einwilligung \u00fcber die Datennutzung generell, ein Zugriff auf Patientenseite findet nicht statt.\nPers\u00f6nliche, einrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Gesundheits- und\u00a0Patientenakte (PEPA)\nDieses Konzept bindet den Patienten bei der Bereitstellung, Einsicht und Freigabe von Gesundheitsdaten aktiv mit ein. \u00dcber ein Patientenportal hat der Patient die M\u00f6glichkeit z.B. Arztbriefe selbstst\u00e4ndig einzustellen (Patienten-Selbstmanagement). Auch hat der Patient die M\u00f6glichkeit selbst zu bestimmen, welche Daten in der Akte gespeichert werden und wer darauf Zugriff haben soll. Die PEPA ist wie die ePA eine fall\u00fcbergreifende bzw. lebenslange Akte und wird sowohl vom Patienten als auch \u00c4rzten dezentral oder \u00fcber angebundene Prim\u00e4rsysteme gepflegt.\nElektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA)\nDie elektronische Gesundheitsakte wird h\u00e4ufig mit der elektronischen Patientenakte gleichgesetzt. Da letztere aber bis auf die PEPA rein \u00e4rztlich gef\u00fchrt ist, ist die eGA so ausgelegt, dass der Patient alleiniger Herr seiner Daten ist und diese beliebig anreichern kann. Versicherte sollen selbst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, welche Diagnosen oder Medikamente sie darauf speichern m\u00f6chten und wem sie Einsicht gew\u00e4hren wollen. Voraussetzung ist, dass die eGA das Erheben, Verarbeiten und Nutzen von Daten \u00fcber Befunde, Diagnosen, Therapien, Behandlungsberichte sowie Impfungen f\u00fcr eine fall- und einrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Dokumentation \u00fcber den Patienten unterst\u00fctzt\nTechnische Standards\nAus der Notwendigkeit einer einheitlichen Kommunikation und der Herstellung von Interoperabilit\u00e4t, haben sich verschiedene Standards entwickelt, die den technischen Kontext f\u00fcr elektronische Patientenakten bilden.\nIntegrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHR)\nIHE ist eine internationale, gemeinn\u00fctzige Initiative aus Industrie und Fachanwendern, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Interoperabilit\u00e4t zwischen IT-Systemen im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Die von IHE entwickelten Standards (IHE-Profile) unterst\u00fctzen eine Vielzahl klinischer Prozesse und enthalten auch optionale Funktionen und sind bestimmten Dom\u00e4nen z.B. f\u00fcr Augenheilkunde, Radiologie, Technische Infrastruktur, etc. zugeordnet. F\u00fcr den Einsatz von elektronischen Patientenakten ist das IHE Profil XDS (Cross-Enterprise Dokument Sharing) hervorzuheben, welches eine standardisierte Spezifikation f\u00fcr die gemeinsame, einrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Nutzung von Dokumenten beschreibt.\nHL7\nHL7 ist, \u00e4hnlich wie IHR, eine internationale Gruppe, die einheitliche Standards f\u00fcr den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Gesundheitsinstitutionen- und Systemen entwickelt. Die entwickelten Normen haben die Interoperabilit\u00e4t von verschiedenen Herstellern und Betreibern zum Ziel z.B. zwischen Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) und Praxisverwaltungssystemen (PVS) niedergelassener \u00c4rzte. Der aktuellste Standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) vereinigt die Vorteile der etablierten HL7-Standard-Produktlinien und aktuellen Web-Standards (z.B. XML, JSON, ATOM, HTTPS, OAuth) und legt Wert auf einfache Implementierbarkeit und unterst\u00fctzt die Entwicklung von mobile und cloud-basierte Anwendungen.\nDICOM\u00ae\nDICOM\u00ae steht f\u00fcr Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine und ist der internationale Standard zum \u00dcbertragen, Speichern, Abrufen, Drucken, Verarbeiten und Anzeigen von medizinischen Bildinformationen. Die meisten Hersteller von Systeme f\u00fcr bildgebende Verfahren wie R\u00f6ntgen, MRT, CT haben den Standard in ihren Produkten implementiert. Dadurch wird eine hohe Interoperabilit\u00e4t im Umfeld verschiedener Gesundheitseinrichtungen erm\u00f6glicht. DICOM bildet auch die Grundlage f\u00fcr die digitale Bildarchivierungsystemen sog. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\nAktuelle Praxisbeispiele\nVivy-App\nDie vom gleichnamigen Unternehmen entwickelte App \u201eVivy\u201c wurde in Kooperation von 90 gesetzlichen Krankenkassen und vier privaten Krankenversicherungen auf den Weg gebracht. Die in einem deutschen Rechenzentrum gespeicherten Daten sind Ende-zu-Ende verschl\u00fcsselt und k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber ein gekoppeltes Smartphone mit 2-Faktor-Authentifizierung vom Patienten eingesehen werden. Die App erm\u00f6glicht den Upload von medizinischen Daten und Dokumenten. Die App soll nicht nur die Gesundheitsakte sondern zudem den Impfpass, den Medikationsplan, Notfalldaten, einen\u00a0 Gesundheits-Check sowie eine Arztsuche beinhalten. Mittels Barcode-Scan von Medikamenten sollen auch m\u00f6gliche Wechselwirkungen aufgezeigt werden. Da die App das DICOM-Format beherrscht, k\u00f6nnen auch Daten wie aus bildgebenden Verfahren importiert werden. Der Patient entscheidet, welche Informationen er mit \u00c4rzten und Gesundheitseinrichtungen teilt und kann auch Dokumente l\u00f6schen. Beim Verlust des Schl\u00fcssel sind die Daten allerdings unwiederbringlich verloren. Vivy soll als pers\u00f6nliche Gesundheitsassistent-App f\u00fcr 25 Mio. Versicherte kostenfrei zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt werden.\nTK-Safe \u2013 Techniker Krankenkasse\nEin \u00e4hnliches Konzept wie Vivy stellte Ende April die Techniker Krankenkasse mit ihrer bundesweiten elektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) namens TK-Safe vor. Die zusammen mit IBM entwickelte eGA erm\u00f6glicht es den Versicherten, alle der TK vorliegenden Daten \u00fcber ihr Smartphone in ihre Akte zu laden. Dazu z\u00e4hlen Impfungen, verordnete Medikamente, \u00e4rztliche Diagnosen oder auch R\u00f6ntgenbilder oder Entlassungsdokumente. Die Daten werden zentral Secure Cloud von IBM in Frankfurt am Main gespeichert und sind Ende-zu-Ende verschl\u00fcsselt. Zur Sicherheitsinfrastruktur geh\u00f6rt eine Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung aus regis\u00adtriertem Smartphone und Passworteingabe, bevor der Versicherte in seine eGA gelangt. Auch hier bedeutet der Verlust des Schl\u00fcssel einen unweigerlichen Verlust der Daten.Weder die TK noch IBM haben Zugriff auf die Daten und der Patient allein entscheidet ob und ich welchem Umfang \u00e4rztliches Personal darauf Zugriff erhalten.\nBislang werden die Daten bei Versicherungswechsel oder bei 12-monatiger Nichtnutzung nach 28 Tagen gel\u00f6scht. Perspektivisch soll es aber auch m\u00f6glich sein, die Daten zu anderen Versicherung mitzunehmen. Eine sp\u00e4tere Anbindung an die Telematikinfrastruktur ist geplant. TK-Safe soll k\u00fcnftig mit dem elektronischen Patientenfach kompatibel sein. Das Partnernetzwerk umfasst 16 Kliniken und Betreibergesellschaften wie Agaplesion, die Helios Kliniken, Vivantes und dem Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. TK-Safe steht bundesweit ca. 10 Mio. Versicherten zur Verf\u00fcgung.\nPEPA \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Heidelberg (UKHD)\nDas Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Heidelberg bietet bereits seit 2014 eine pers\u00f6nliche, einrichtungs\u00fcbergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte f\u00fcr Patienten im Rhein-Neckar-Raum an. Relevante Dokumente und Bilddaten k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber standardisierte Schnittstellen Die Prim\u00e4rsysteme der teilnehmenden Einrichtungen werden auf Basis internationaler und offener Standards (HL7, DICOM) sowie Profile (IHE) in die PEPA f\u00fcr die \u00dcbermittlung von Inhalten integriert. Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr ist die Einwilligung des Patienten. Die Einwilligung erfolgt direkt vor Ort im jeweiligen System des Kooperationspartners (Krankenhausinformationssystem oder Praxisverwaltungssystem). Auf diese Weise kann der Patient f\u00fcr jede Einrichtung separat entscheiden, ob und wem er Zugriff auf seine Gesundheitsdaten erm\u00f6glichen m\u00f6chte. S\u00e4mtliche Daten liegen auf gesicherten Servern des UKHD. \u00dcber das pers\u00f6nliche Patientenportal k\u00f6nnen Nutzer auf Ihre PEPA jederzeit zugreifen, Zugriffsfreigaben managen und sehen wer die Daten verwendet hat. Zus\u00e4tzlich sind im Portal zertifizierte Informationsmaterialien abrufbar, die dabei helfen komplexe Befunde zu verstehen. Features wie ein Medikationsplan oder die M\u00f6glichkeit ein Sport- oder Schmerztagebuch zu f\u00fchren sind ebenfalls integriert. Frageb\u00f6gen f\u00fcr Forschungszwecke k\u00f6nnen auch direkt \u00fcber das Smartphone beantwortet werden, sofern der Patient hierf\u00fcr seine Einwilligung erteilt. K\u00fcnftig soll die PEPA auch mit der eGA TK-Safe vernetzt werden, so dass die Daten zwischen den Systemen ausgetauscht werden k\u00f6nnen. An die PEPA sind aktuell das UKHD und die Thoraxklinik Heidelberg sowie regionale Praxen angeschlossen. Das Krankenhaus Salem in Heidelberg und das Kreiskrankenhaus Bergstra\u00dfe sind in Vorbereitung f\u00fcr eine Anbindung.\nFazit\nAktuell tritt genau das ein, was von Seiten der Politik, Spitzenverb\u00e4nden aus Medizin und Versicherern und \u00c4rzteschaft vermieden werden sollte: Die Entstehung von Insell\u00f6sungen. Durch fehlende Spezifikationen, langwierige Entwicklungsprozesse bei der TI, ePA/ePF und fehlende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen entwickeln Akteure im Gesundheitswesen und Ihre Partner eigene L\u00f6sungen.\nEine \u00fcbergreifende Interoperabilit\u00e4t zwischen den Systemen scheint aber noch in weiter Ferne, vor allem da noch viele Versicherer keine eigene ePA-Strategie entwickelt haben und die k\u00fcnftige Telematikinfrastruktur weiter auf sich warten l\u00e4sst. Bei \u00fcber 70 Mio. gesetzlich Versicherter in Deutschland erreichen die bisherigen Konzepte daher noch nicht einmal die H\u00e4lfte aller m\u00f6glichen Nutzer in Deutschland.\nAuf der anderen Seite darf f\u00fcr Kliniken und \u00c4rzte die Dokumentation in der ePA zu keinem b\u00fcrokratischen Mehraufwand f\u00fchren, was eine tiefe Integration in die genutzten Prim\u00e4rsysteme erfordert. Bislang k\u00f6nnen diese entscheiden, auf welches Konzept sie mit aufspringen wollen. Ob sich dieses am Ende durchsetzt bzw. f\u00fcr einen \u00fcbergreifenden Datenaustausch verf\u00fcgbar, bleibt offen. Die Auswahl der \"richtigen\" L\u00f6sung ist damit entscheidend f\u00fcr den Einstieg in die digitale Patientenakte und f\u00fcr nachhaltige Kostenersparnisse im Gesundheitssektor.\n\u00dcber Moritz Bachmann\nAls Inbound Sales Manager bildet Moritz Bachmann die Schnittstelle zwischen dem internen Online-Marketing und dem Bereich Sales bei comwrap.

A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\nRelated: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports .\n"}, "ba4dfe2d3e817ff7b8b01172ccc307850fc5469bcdd26c3c48ca046cb88ab7cf": {"articleBody": "Science\nBubonic plague: Third case of plague in China as panic begins \u2013 \u2018The plague is coming\u2019\nA THIRD case of the plague has been reported in China \u2013 with the public beginning to panic over the potential outbreak.\nPUBLISHED: 00:01, Tue, Nov 19, 2019\n| UPDATED: 10:43, Tue, Nov 19, 2019\n0\nHealth authorities in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia have confirmed that a third instance of the plague has been reported, after two people contracted it in Beijing earlier this month.

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\nAccording to The Verge\u2019s Stadia review , the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a statement\u2026\nGoogle Stadia Pricing for Games Available Now \u2013 Pro Subscribers Get Discounts\nWhen streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn\u2019t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised \u2013 it's revealed in Eurogamer\u2019s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn\u2019t terrible. If you\u2019re not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles, \u00a0it\u2019s not a bad alternative. That said, Google promised more, and for whatever reason, they\u2019re not delivering yet.

(AP) \u2014 About a dozen black female small-business owners were gathered in a South Carolina shared workspace on Tuesday night for a networking event when they were told the newest 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, Deval Patrick, would be stopping by to introduce himself.\nWhen Patrick walked into the back of the room mid-meeting, the women turned around as he sheepishly apologized for his tardiness and short stay.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me!\u201d he told them.\nBut the black former Massachusetts governor is eager to get their attention \u2014 and their vote.\nLaunching his bid for president less than three months before the Iowa caucuses, Patrick is betting that he can make his case to a broad coalition of voters, including many who remain undecided or uncommitted to anyone in the crowded field of candidates. To win South Carolina, which holds the first Southern primary of 2020, he would need a base of support from the black voters who comprise roughly two-thirds of the state\u2019s Democratic electorate.\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president because those values of community, that we have a stake in each other and of generational responsibility, I think, are frayed in the country,\u201d Patrick said Tuesday night in Columbia. \u201cI come in humbly. ... I want to be a listener.\u201d\nArguing that voters are just now beginning to tune in, with the first votes less than 100 days away, Patrick has said he will have visibility when the populace is really paying attention. His late entry, though, makes it that much tougher to raise the awareness that his campaign will need to meet the polling and fundraising thresholds for future debates.\nThis week, Patrick launched a tour of early-voting states, visiting Nevada and Iowa before South Carolina. It\u2019s a state where former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained a significant polling lead for months, both across all spectrums and with black voters specifically.\nIt\u2019s also a place where the two other major black candidates in the race \u2014 Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris \u2014 have struggled to gain momentum, despite months of campaign events.\nEyamba Sowers didn\u2019t know Patrick was coming to Tuesday\u2019s networking gathering but saw his visit as a pleasant surprise. The real estate agent said she related to him as someone who was also raised in a single-parent home, and she was impressed with his status as the country\u2019s second elected black governor.\n\u201cHe has me thinking now,\u201d said Sowers, who is also considering Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. She said if Patrick can get his message out, he\u2019s someone voters could see defeating President Donald Trump in 2020 \u2014 her top priority.\nBeth Ruffin said she didn\u2019t know much about Patrick before Tuesday\u2019s event, but he left her intrigued and wanting to learn more. A former Beto O\u2019Rourke supporter, she is a voter back on the market since his departure from the presidential race.\n\u201cIt sounded like strong black women raised him,\u201d said Ruffin, who owns a diversity and inclusion consulting firm and headed out for Patrick\u2019s second stop at a nearby restaurant, where he was warmly greeted by a crowd of several dozen. \u201cI want to see how he translates that into policy.\u201d\n___\nReach the reporters on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and http://twitter.com/emarvelous\nMost Popular\n"}, "8380689f358c1e3a0f6fca6e11ed13e5304a74060139f7a584347db213950446": {"articleBody": "Does Marie Yovanovitch Have a Net Worth of $17 Million?\nDoes Marie Yovanovitch Have a Net Worth of $17 Million?\nAn unsubstantiated rumor was circulated in November 2019 in an apparent attempt to discredit the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million.\nRating\nDo you rely on Snopes reporting? Click here to support it.\nOrigin\nOn Nov. 15, 2019, former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Shortly after, some of Trump\u2019s defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador\u2019s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence.\u00a0 Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune.\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates.\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch\u2019s net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates.\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure.\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony.\nSnopes.com\nA Word to Our Loyal Readers\nSupport Snopes and make a difference for readers everywhere.\nRead the Letter\n"}, "abd9d6291b6bfae0c3ffad8ab7623b482c6da46face0271dc42af6324d8f0ce5": {"articleBody": "Doctors offer to give free flu shots to detained migrants, warn of epidemic\nSuzanne Gamboa\n2 US service members die in Afghanistan chopper crash\nA group of physicians, alarmed that the Trump administration is denying flu vaccines to immigrants in custody, is urging the Department of Homeland Security to accept its offer to provide free flu shots to California detainees.\n\u00a9 John Brecher Needle poking skin during administration of flu shot at Mary's Center, a community health center in Washington.\nIn a Nov. 5 letter, the doctors pleaded with the administration to reconsider its decision to not vaccinate detained migrants for flu despite the deaths of at least three children in CBP custody during the 2018 flu season.\nThe doctors, members of a recently formed group Doctors for Camp Closure, D4CC , have offered to stage a mobile flu vaccine at no cost to the government at the San Ysidro, California, Customs and Border Protection processing and detention facility.\n\u201cWe implore you to allow our volunteer physicians to hold our requested influenza vaccine clinic,\u201d the physicians stated in the letter.\nCustoms and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security, did not accept the offer. A spokesperson who did not wish to be named because of agency policy said in a statement emailed to NBC News that the agency never has administered vaccines and people aren't usually held in custody very long.\n\u00a9 Lucy Nicholson Detainees at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, Calif., on May 18, 2018.\n\"As a law enforcement agency and due to the short term nature of CBP holding and other logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible,\" the spokesperson said.\nAlthough CBP\u2019s guidelines recommend holding people no longer than 72 hours, the agency has been holding people far longer as arrivals of migrants seeking asylum spiked last year and this year, although they have since fallen.\n\"We write with urgency\"\nIn a Nov. 5 letter to Kevin McAleenan, who was the acting director of the Department of Homeland Security and Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, said they would provide 100 doses of the influenza vaccines and four volunteer physicians to administer them. McAleenan resigned and Chad Wolf has been named new DHS acting secretary.\n\"This is how epidemics begin,\" Dr. Luz Contreras Arroyo, a member of the group and signatory to the letter, told NBC News. \"It's not just migrants. Workers will come out to communities, potentially spreading that virus and it could get out of control.\"\n\"These are people as well,\" Arroyo added, speaking of the detained families. \"They are under the care of the government, most not having committed crimes. Seeking asylum is not a crime.\"\nThe group had set a deadline of Tuesday for the administration to respond before making the request public.\nThe doctors warned that migrants are not the only people at risk of illness.\n\"Flu season has already begun in many parts of the country, so we write with urgency,\" the doctors stated. \"Many people, including those working at and living near CBP facilities, will be at an even higher risk than what is typical.\"\nThe doctors contributed money and raised more from friends and others to pay the cost of the vaccines. Physicians are volunteering their time to provide the shots, said Arroyo, a Sacramento family medicine physician and psychiatrist.\nThe doctors said they also have an established volunteer network of physicians licensed to operate in all states to get the necessary vaccines and work with CBP to \u201ccreate a system to ensure that the majority of migrant families\u201d held in CBP custody are vaccinated.\nThey hope for government funding to help pay the cost for vaccines systemwide. If not, they will try to find other funding.\n\"Alarming mortality rate\"\nThe doctors said that based on an estimated 200,000 children in federal custody in the past two years, the three deaths of detained children attributed to complications from the flu are nine times higher than the expected death rate for children from flu.\n\u201cIn our professional medical opinion, this alarming mortality rate constitutes an emergency which threatens the safety of human lives, particularly children,\u201d says the letter signed by seven physicians.\nIn August, CBP announced that it would not be vaccinating migrant families in its holding centers ahead of the flu season. At the time, the agency said in a statement that it chose not to provide the vaccinations because of the \u201cshort-term\u201d stays of immigrants in custody and the complexities of operating a vaccination program.\nBut Arroyo said the government has done wide scale vaccinations before and given out large amounts of vaccine to prevent illness from spreading and prevent epidemics. She said it is cost effective and less than the cost of hospitals and ICUs for detainees, staff and residents once they become sick.\nCBP's cells and pens of chain-link fence with concrete floors and holding rooms are known to be very cold and are often called hieleras, which translates to freezer or icebox, by those held in them, which include infant children.\nHealth care providers have protested longer detention periods for migrants, warning that children in particular would face more serious health risks with the extended incarcerations .\nOvercrowded conditions worsen risk\nThe doctors offering to operate the flu vaccination clinic noted findings of overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at detention facilities by the DHS Office of Inspector General.\nThat report found children in some CBP facilities didn\u2019t have access to showers, didn\u2019t always have opportunities to change clothes and that they had limited space for medical isolation. In an El Paso facility, a cell meant for 35 held 155 adult males with only one toilet and sink, NBC News reported .\nA flu outbreak at the CBP McAllen facility affected nearly three dozen immigrants and required a temporary suspension of operations.\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends all individuals above age 6 months get a flu vaccine by the end of October for the current flu season. Even the policy manual of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department, notes the CDC requirement that immigrants be vaccinated for flu.\n\u201cAs physicians, we have seen the effects of flu infections in the strongest as well as the most vulnerable, and the outcomes can be devastating,\u201d the physicians stated.\n"}, "d1c57d7821e5a5b27fb468c59489601bb2a042b1c05221166e3221d2b5dc217f": {"articleBody": "by Jeff Foust \u2014\nNovember 18, 2019\nSpaceX said its Starship lunar lander will be able to transport 100 metric tons to the surface of the moon, far more than NASA's requirements under the CLPS program. Credit: SpaceX\nWASHINGTON \u2014 NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\nNASA said the five companies \u2014 Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems \u2014 had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\nThis \u201con-ramp\u201d to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA\u2019s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission , a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n\u201cWe were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,\u201d Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA\u2019s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n\u201cWe do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,\u201d said Shotwell, referring to NASA\u2019s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX\u2019s commercial cargo capability.\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a \u201cnice stepping stone\u201d to later crewed missions. She didn\u2019t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship \u201ca lot\u201d before flying any missions with people on board.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May , capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. \u201cIt has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,\u201d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. \u201cOur company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,\u201d said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company\u2019s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA\u2019s broader plans. \u201cSpace exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.\u201d He said his company\u2019s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with something smaller,\u201d he said. \u201cOur flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.\u201d He declined to say when his company\u2019s lander would be ready.\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago : Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later , citing internal business issues.\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released \u201csometime soon\u201d for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two \u201cdeliveries\u201d of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n"}, "e372e42c0a3df7b86e1c0bacf7bc14d042144a01e88833bc5a643d61b3547090": {"articleBody": "Son of former German president stabbed to death in Berlin\nBy JERUSALEM POST STAFF\nNOVEMBER 20, 2019 10:43\nThe son of former German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, Fritz Eckart von Weizs\u00e4cker was stabbed to death, while another man was critically injured in an attempt to stop the assailant, Kan reported on Wednesday.\nThe stabbing occurred during a presentation led by von Weizs\u00e4cker at the Schlosspark-Klinik in Berlin, where he worked as a chief physician.Police arrested a 57-year-old man suspect of committing the assassination.\nBy subscribing I accept the terms of use\nInformation\nPersonas Media\nThe Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be contacted with any questions or requests:\n\n            Telephone: *2421 * Extension 4 Jerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax: 03-5613699E-mail: subs@jpost.com\n\n            The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 and 14:00 and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 and\u00a0\n            13:00\n\n            For international customers: The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 6PM\u00a0\n\n            Toll Free number in Israel only 1-800-574-574\u00a0\n            Telephone +972-3-761-9056\n            Fax: 972-3-561-3699\n            E-mail: subs@jpost.com\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Jpost Inc.

In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said he pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a little and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases.\n\u201cMy people had $20 billion done,\u201d Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I want more.\u2019 They said, \u2018The farmers can\u2019t handle it.\u2019 I said, \u2018Tell them to buy larger tractors. It\u2019s very simple.\u2019\u201d The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the president\u2019s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe.\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a \u201chistoric\u201d Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. \u201cI like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.\u201d\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing , which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession .\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. \u201cThe uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we\u2019re experiencing today.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe , Japan , Canada and Mexico , publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.\nThe president says his approach has created leverage \u2014 and in some cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table.\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president\u2019s \u201cmercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team\u201d had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. \u201cBy hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,\u201d he said.\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests . Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States \u201cfarm country,\u201d but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president\u2019s unpredictable behavior \u2014 as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking.\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect \u2014 or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\n\u201cIt makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,\u201d said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t fit well with the world of global supply chains. And we\u2019re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\u201d\nEven Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesn\u2019t want the show to end.\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced \u201cnear-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardship\u201d stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying \u201ctime is running out for many in agriculture.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested \u2014 larger purchases \u201cthan any time in our history, by far\u201d \u2014 into the actual text of a trade agreement.\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries\u2019, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\nMr. Trump\u2019s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached.\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China\u2019s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.\n\u201cWithout rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?\u201d He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\nAdvertisement\n"}, "5fa5679de56c43edf70685762c2d1f2de296432ae53aa46e075b552fee17cab8": {"articleBody": "Photo: iFixit\nThe big iFixit teardown is done, and the results are in . The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a few meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro\u2014as in Apple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them as new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-based computer company is what I\u2019ll call rewind design.\nI\u2019m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop , as it should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger display, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card. Then there are those retro features. There\u2019s a physical escape button just like there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow keys are once again arranged in an inverted \u201cT\u201d formation, as they had been on keyboards for decades. The new \u201cMagic Keyboard\u201d uses a scissor switch that\u2019s almost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released nearly five years ago.\nAdvertisement\nThe keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage sparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel design contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released in 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small bit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing the entire upper half of the laptop . Apple admitted to the flawed design and launched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered free keyboard repairs for all MacBook s with the new mechanism. The company was still trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it launched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered MacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show up on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.\nBut the new design isn\u2019t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown , the 16-inch MacBook\u2019s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic Keyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from 2015\u2014one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times\u2014with a design from 2015 that wasn\u2019t so flawed. It\u2019s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision almost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it\u2019s just going back in time and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical escape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016 , and for the new inverted \u201cT\u201d arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back in 2015.\nPhoto: iFixit\nThis is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple\u2019s MacBook team was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company\u2019s design team decided to fix a few things that weren\u2019t broken and break a few more things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just replacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old things, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the crispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too bad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back to the old one.\nAdvertisement\nOnce again, I\u2019m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with broken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of the Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I love it! I especially love how the keys don\u2019t break constantly. And while we\u2019re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, which I hate\u2014although I would hate it slightly less if it had a physical escape key. I\u2019m honestly impartial on the inverted \u201cT\u201d arrow key thing, but I know some people are passionate about it .\nWhat does bug me about Apple\u2019s new take on innovation is that it confirms the belief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this last year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation and more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out to be true. In recent months, we\u2019ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which amounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera , as well as the new Apple TV+ streaming service, which is a bit bland . They\u2019re not bad products. But they\u2019re certainly not groundbreaking.\nAdvertisement\nThe same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I\u2019ll reserve final judgment until I\u2019ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for an operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I\u2019ll like it. I just can\u2019t stop wondering if I\u2019ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my understanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many years ago. It\u2019s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented reality headset in the next couple of years. Maybe its designers have been so busy working on that futuristic product that they couldn\u2019t focus on perfecting keyboard design. Surely they\u2019ve been busy doing better things.\nShare This Story\n"}, "08f793762792bd252c75fb57544cdf506ffcc04785136cb87503f02364b82b56": {"articleBody": "Nov 18, 2019\n            at\n                    \n    9:24 pm ET\n\u2022 2 min read\nThe Steelers spent Monday trying to distance themselves from Thursday night's fight that led to multi-game suspensions for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett and Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey . Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson , however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. \u2026 You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds .\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\nPick Six Newsletter\nGet the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks and power rankings.\nI agree that CBS Sports can send me the \"Pick Six Newsletter\" newsletter.\nPlease check the opt-in box to acknowledge that you would like to subscribe.\nThanks for signing up!\nKeep an eye on your inbox for the latest sports news.\nSorry!\nThere was an error processing your subscription.\n2019 NFL Playoff Picture\n"}, "b6906ca016bbfc64c90426e098c75b3e8c84457a77f51f1e7ea6941cb80c2147": {"articleBody": "PolitiFact\u2019s guide to understanding tariffs and international trade\nBy Louis Jacobson on Monday, November 18th, 2019 at 11:04 a.m.\nAn MSC cargo ship leaves PortMiami, on Aug. 31, 2019. (AP)\nBreaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war.\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States\u2019 leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump\u2019s tariff decisions.\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer \u2014 not richer.\"\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn\u2019t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they\u2019re usually U.S. companies.\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer \u2014 say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written . \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported . Companies that don\u2019t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It\u2019s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\nDon\u2019t tariffs produce revenue?\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\nThat\u2019s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that\u2019s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\nAs we\u2019ve noted , a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China\u2019s gross domestic product.\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018.\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment.\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers .\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases , harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\nAdvertisement\n"}, "ecb46e3e489d2aac92b2563112e1801077b4219a6db9751f18e228bcaf457802": {"articleBody": "Nelson's OT goal lifts Isles\nN.Y. completes frantic comeback to extend unbeaten streak to 15\nAssociated Press\n11:26\u00a0pm EST, Tuesday, November 19, 2019\nPittsburgh\nBrock Nelson's second goal of the game 2:55 into overtime capped a frantic comeback to lift the New York Islanders over the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-4 Tuesday night to extend their unbeaten streak to 15 games.\nThe Islanders trailed by two late in the third period before goals by Josh Bailey and Ryan Pulock in the final 4:29 of regulation forced overtime.

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009\u2019s Star Trek and 2013\u2019s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J.

And, based on these broad qualifiers, Stadia delivers.\n[ Engadget ]\nStadia isn't a console. It's a platform for streaming games from the cloud. You can play Stadia titles on a TV, on a computer or on a smartphone, although there are limitations on all of these categories, as I'll discuss later. You buy whichever game you want to play from Google, then stream it right away. There's no initial download, no patching and no buffering \u2014 just instantaneous gameplay.\n[ Tom's Guide ]\nStadia Is Essentially A Beta Version Until 2020, But The Price Tag Isn't Cheap\nCome November 19, those who anted up $129 for the Google Stadia Founder's Edition or functionally identical Premiere Edition will receive a Stadia controller, a 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra, and three months of the $10-a-month Stadia Pro subscription. This is the only way to get access to Stadia right now and for the foreseeable future.\nAnd there's a reason for that: It's the only use case that feels finished. Google Stadia arrives with a litany of missing features, especially on PC and phones. As such, the Chromecast is the only device that supports 4K streaming at release, as well as 5.1 surround sound and the wireless Stadia controller. Those features won't hit other platforms until 2020.\n[ PC World ]\nStadia's launch day is Tuesday\u2026 sort of. Really, consider this the start of Stadia's early-access beta period. Because Google's big promises haven't arrived, and at the price of the Stadia's Founder's Edition, I can't recommend anyone jump onboard at the moment. Google's experimental game streaming service, Stadia, launches without many of its promised features, and just a handful of games. It works, but there's not much incentive to buy in.\n[ CNET ]\nDespite The Monthly Fee, You're Still Buying \u2014 Not Renting \u2014 Games\nWhile you've probably heard predictions that Google's Stadia will be the \"Netflix of games,\" it turns out the analogy only goes so far. While Google intends to eventually have a back catalog of free games included for your $10 monthly fee, Stadia is not primarily a subscription service. The subscription only includes a single game as of today \u2014 Destiny 2. Primarily, Google tells us you should expect to buy, not rent cloud games for the same retail prices you'd find on other platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam.\n[ The Verge ]\nEven when Stadia is at its best though, there's a catch: You will never own your Stadia games. You will never have local copies on your hardware, which means you have access to your games (games you paid for) only as long as they stay in the Stadia library. If Google decides to remove certain titles, or shutter the service entirely (it happens, pretty often in fact), the games you paid for will be gone.\n[ Wired ]\nStadia's Current Roster Of Games Isn't Very Impressive\nStadia's 22 launch titles are uninspiring. They include: Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2, Destiny 2: The Collection, Farming Simulator 2019, Final Fantasy XV, Football Manager 2020, Grid 2019, Gylt, Just Dance 2020, Kine, Metro Exodus, Mortal Kombat 11, NBA 2K20, Rage 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Samurai Shodown, Thumper, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2013, Trials Rising, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. About half came out this year, one is a Stadia exclusive (Gylt), and almost all of them are available on other platforms.\n[ Inverse ]\nProvided You Have A Solid Internet Connection, The Streaming Quality Seems To Be Mostly Excellent\nStadia's performance is promising at worst, and impressive at best. Sitting in my bedroom, controller in hand, streaming Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4K resolution, HDR color and 5.1 surround sound without a console anywhere in sight, I couldn't help but feel a little astounded. If this is the future of gaming, I could get used to it, at least on some level.\n[ Tom's Guide ]\nThe bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google's servers over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the same. For \"best performance\", Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every other time, it was perfect.\n[ The Guardian ]\nI have very fast internet connection at home, so the games were really crisp and fluid most of the time. It felt, generally, like I was playing on a regular console. But every now and again, I'd be reminded I was streaming when the graphics in a game dropped to a lower quality, or if the game just unexpectedly quit. That doesn't happen often on an Xbox or a PS4, and it's bad news if you're trying to finish a level or fight someone in a multiplayer game.\n[ CNBC]\nThe Stadia Controller Is Only Necessary For Playing On A TV, But It's Very Comfortable\nGoogle's gone way over the top comparing the controller to a chef's knife, but it's an excellent controller, seriously. It feels something like a blend of the XBox One controller and Nintendo Switch pro controller, with smooth analog triggers, solid rumble haptics, crisp analog sticks and d-pad. Playing with it feels effortless. I like how the Stadia button turns the platform on, and a solid rumble-throb kicks in to let you know the service has connected.\n[ CNET ]\nThe controller is really comfortable to hold over long periods of time and has good battery life. That's important, since it's the only way to control the games you're playing. The button layout is different, but it was just as comfortable and really similar to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller. Setup between devices was usually pretty easy. I just turned the controller on and plugged it into either the Pixel 3a or computer I was using. Google says the controller will eventually work wirelessly with phones as it does with the Chromecast Ultra.\n[ CNBC ]\nTL;DR\nThere's no reason anyone should buy into Stadia right now. Google has made sure of that, partly by underdelivering at launch and partly with a pricing scheme that sees you paying three times (for hardware, for the service, for games) just to be an early adopter.\n[ The Verge ]\nIs Google Stadia the future? That's really two questions, I guess. First, \"Is streaming the future of gaming?\" Possibly. It's convenient, and even exciting at times. But if you're asking whether Stadia is the platform to get us there? I have my doubts.\n"}, "686bb170effe273eaff1c0f88e412172e8d972518a6d1454c896f52aafaa9643": {"articleBody": "Europa's plumes appear to be real, but very sporadic.\nShares\nAn artist's illustration of a plume of water vapor emanating from Jupiter's moon Europa.\n(Image: \u00a9 NASA/ESA/K. Retherford/SWRI)\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa , which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system . But the third \u2014 liquid water \u2014 is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\nRelated: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life .\nThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights \u2014\u00a0April 26, 2016 \u2014 they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff \u2014\u00a0about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper , which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus , which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.\nNASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper , which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years \u2014\u00a0 or if they just get really lucky.\n"}, "eb62ac8425e5573947ecde962d14433d18e5725cc4a8c908fe22f678e96a65a1": {"articleBody": "Taylor Swift's big night; Britney Spears' new pop-up\nHollywood Nation: Taylor Swift will be honored with the coveted Artist of the Decade award at the 2019 American Music Awards ceremony; Britney Spears is giving devoted followers the ultimate fan experience with a Los Angeles pop-up and retail shop celebrating the pop star's iconic career opening in January 2020.\nScooter Braun is allegedly\u00a0unhappy with the way his business partner Scott Borchetta has handled their ongoing public schism with Taylor Swift , according to a new report by E!

The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but \u201can articulated lorry crash\u201d performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein\u2019s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\n\u201cPrince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,\u201d said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\u201cHis friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,\u201d the expert warned.\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein\u2019s \u201cunbecoming\u201d behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago \u2013 on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein\u2019s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 \u2013 after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution \u2013 in order to terminate his friendship.\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein\u2019s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: \u201cI took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken\u2019s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.\u201d\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were \u201cnot close\u201d.\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew\u2019s otherwise \u201clack of remorse\u201d or \u201csympathy\u201d with the victims of Epstein\u2019s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\nLawyers for Epstein\u2019s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak.

But if you take courses on doing these \u201cdeep end\u201d things before you\u2019ve done some of the \u201cshallow end\u201d things I\u2019m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated \u2014 not inspired.\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m about to cover \u2026 the first steps. They\u2019re crucial!\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n1. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\nHere\u2019s an analogy:\nWhen you\u2019re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses \u2014 planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both \u2014 there\u2019s a helpful way to think about what you\u2019re doing.\nImagine you\u2019re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you\u2019re doing back there!\nYou\u2019re planning and building what you\u2019ll reveal to the world \u2014 but you haven\u2019t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.\nHere\u2019s what I want you to remember \u2026\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?\nNo one is watching.\nI mean, if you\u2019re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There\u2019s almost no one there.\nIt\u2019s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won\u2019t feel as intimidated by the process.\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section \u2026\n2. Don\u2019t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse\u2019s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online \u201cevents\u201d that build your audience.\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\nAnd I\u00a0used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is \u2026\nIt\u2019s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.\nEveryone\u2019s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:\nNOT SCARY\nWriting a piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on the phone\nKIND OF SCARY\nSending the piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on a video call\nINTIMIDATING\nParticipating in a podcast interview\nSpeaking as a member of a panel\nPresenting a live webinar\nDelivering the keynote speech at a conference\nHosting a live video on a social media platform\nPublishing and promoting a book\nHere\u2019s the thing:\nI didn\u2019t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.\nInstead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you\u2019ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.\nThe good news?\nYou\u2019ll have a strong success mindset and you\u2019ll be ready for it all.\n3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us \u2026 without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don\u2019t want to.\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the \u201cvisibility spectrum\u201d toward a leadership role, it\u2019s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of \u2026\n\u201cArgh! I know I need to do this but it\u2019s scary!\u201d\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be \u201creal\u201d with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\nI\u2019m very happy to say that a I\u2019m building that team of people for you right now.\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more about the BIG League \u2014 my community for online business builders \u2014 download the Online Business Success Roadmap .

They might struggle to cut down, use so much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and spend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\nIn adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the past month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use isn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent to 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\nThe number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use disorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group in other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\nBut among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis use in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint.

The general public should be informed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make informed decisions,\" Martins said.\nIan Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of Health Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: \"Although the researchers found that regular use increased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate to a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis.

The researchers weren't, for instance, able to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used, \"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently which wouldn't create the same degree of risk as those using high potency cannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.\nHamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers and manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health benefits, and even basic information on strength.\n\"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely risk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at risk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time it is often too late,\" Hamilton said.\nBut he said the results also don't mean cannabis shouldn't be legalized, rather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support services need to be adequately funded and available, something other states and countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis policies.\"\nCannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal | Health\nSign up for our Newsletter\n"}, "d48aeb9cf2f2ff15769a57513249b4a6a669159f3e50b335e741d4206a824e88": {"articleBody": "Email\nInstagram began testing hiding public like counts globally on Thursday, after experimenting with the design tweak in several individual markets abroad. People who upload photos and videos will still know how many people liked them\u2014that information just won\u2019t be seen by other users. The experiment is part of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical one, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like Instagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the toxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like counts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that puts less prominence on likes and retweets.\nBut Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called demetrication to a wider segment of users. It\u2019s previously tested removing likes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning likes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be \u201ca space that feels much less pressurized.\u201d But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly encouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics can provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into Instagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is also a gateway to buying ads.\nInstagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140 million monthly active \u201cbusinesses\u201d across Facebook\u2019s various platforms, according to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a \u201cbusiness\u201d or \u201c creator \u201d one at any time, both of which come with souped-up analytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money from their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of influencers , where the line between personal branding and personal life has all but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram profile like it\u2019s a job\u2014and Instagram is happy to help.\nKym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company notifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal accounts into business ones. \u201cWe use a machine learning model which predicts likely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts that may benefit from professional tools like analytics,\u201d they said in an email. It\u2019s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to say.\nI changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a professional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type of business you run, and I earnestly chose \u201cJournalist.\u201d I later found that many people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or Well Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store. After a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see things like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my profile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories. It was eye-opening.\nAdvertisement\nI learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I tagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some reason or another, visited my profile in the last week\u2014but only 16 had come from the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I had written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business account informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message, but I couldn\u2019t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends and acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.\n\u201cI was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without posting for several months,\u201d said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched to a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view his profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. \u201cIt really made me take a step back and ask what are they looking for on here? and in all seriousness, could I have a cyberstalker?\u201d\nInstagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including how many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. \u201cI was on vacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my 1,000 followers, five swiped away,\u201d said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for Amazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. \u201cIt\u2019s like wholesome content, that\u2019s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following me was like nah, not for me dog.\u201d\nEven though Instagram\u2019s professional analytics are extremely granular, they\u2019re still anonymized, and can\u2019t account for the reason why someone took a specific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know. \u201cSince I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14 followers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don\u2019t post as often anymore,\u201d said Minga. \u201cI think I have some sort of social media stage fright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me feel insecure.\u201d\nIs there something you think we should know about Instagram? Email the writer at louise_matsakis@wired.com .

That includes where they live, how old they are, whether they\u2019re male of female (there\u2019s no recognition of users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day they\u2019re active on the platform. It\u2019s easy to see how this information would be useful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to know more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large \u201cPromote\u201d button to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.\nAs both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there\u2019s a security risk associated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous for minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally make their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make it easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with business accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the world.\nWIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were masquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram, but didn\u2019t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. \u201cI am so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to technology,\u201d she said. \u201cI am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has a public Instagram account with his phone number on it.\u201d Her daughter, on the other hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.\n\u201cBusinesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion flow that the contact information they would like to make public to help people contact them will be displayed,\u201d Lino said. Last month, Instagram also made it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display their contact information.\nDavid Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent the last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have professional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching Instagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users can easily toggle between being corporations, \u201ccreators,\u201d and normal people, Stier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have blurred. \u201cThis thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of classifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,\u201d he says.\nMaybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped thousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The boundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone. Microinfluencers , and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand followers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and shampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe not, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n"}, "39d5c43beb60605c3eec760c99500e62e7bd71ebbe4ae05edf382125e1b0b80a": {"articleBody": "Beijing tariff demands may expand US-China trade deal\nBeijing tariff demands may expand US-China trade deal\nX Share via\nNov 20 2019, 11:06am ist\nupdated: Nov 20 2019, 15:24pm ist\nA \"phase one\" trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\nBut it may morph into something bigger if US\u00a0President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\nChina's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has US\u00a0officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US\u00a0farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\u00a0maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US\u00a0put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\nTrump and US\u00a0Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US\u00a0on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\nDH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\nGET IT\n"}, "042bb7b5fedab6eac7db576522b89b93904c237d344bcbe14a6a5ab7f7335856": {"articleBody": "Sarah.Needleman@wsj.com\nNov. 19, 2019 8:03 am ET\nGaming used to be so simple.

At the time, Lexus called the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and streets worldwide.\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally pulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC Convertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply been carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept appears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the Coupe.\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard LC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a fixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top. Lexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won\u2019t be seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very stylish with the roof down. However, some might find it\u2019s roofline a bit strange with the soft-top roof up.\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding soft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it just takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air freshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin temperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply been carried over from the coupe.\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko Hazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity by adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to reduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated and reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\nUnder the hood, it\u2019s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471 horsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine noise into the cabin.\nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020. Considering how Lexus Philippines offers almost all Lexus models locally, it's possible the LC500 Convertible could arrive in the future.\n"}, "9e8c9f082a8d77c58c17bda03b6b4bb6a1d6883fe196c252db4ca83b9991e0d3": {"articleBody": "\"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\n\u2014 David McKinley on Sunday, October 13th, 2019 in an article in a local newspaper\nWhat is the value of drugs that come to the U.S. border?\nBy Matthew Digby , Minh Do on Monday, November 18th, 2019 at 11:08 a.m.\nThe Mexico-U.S. border check point near the Nogales/Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Ariz. (AP)\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say you\u2019ve got to pay attention to this \u2014 $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer , the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? It\u2019s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we\u2019ll interpret McKinley\u2019s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley\u2019s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHere\u2019s the most recent data on drug seizures \u2014 cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl \u2014 from Customs and Border Protection .\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff\u2019s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\nThat\u2019s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it\u2019s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It\u2019s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That\u2019s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nAdvertisement\n"}, "7ab16ade32386ece353b8d31fc3bb7e660189efd5bf3c8549aaba101ad3f5ef5": {"articleBody": "Commentary\nIs Football Violence a Crime?\nNFL assaults have led to lawsuits before.

Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\nIt\u2019s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\nAt the front, there\u2019s Audi\u2019s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It\u2019s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road \u2013 such as markings \u2013 with extra-precision.\nFor the rear, there\u2019s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It\u2019ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\nEurope will get the option of Audi\u2019s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\nPower and Performance\nIn Europe, there\u2019ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They\u2019ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\nIt\u2019ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to \u201cS\u201d and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It\u2019s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\nQuattro is standard, and there\u2019s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select \u2013 with seven different drive modes \u2013 will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\nRange and Charging\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\nStill, there\u2019ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\nFor Level 2 stations, there\u2019ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge \u2013 which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in \u2013 will also be enabled in 2020.\nInterior and Technology\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or \u201cfrunk,\u201d you\u2019re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker\u2019s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There\u2019ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi\u2019s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there\u2019ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it\u2019ll also be used to control a new \u201cfunctions on demand\u201d system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback \u201cedition one\u201d: it\u2019ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\nStory Timeline\n"}, "c467d507551a836efa9cfe843ba5d7bafe519750e04d0c9ff0decf44f013f829": {"articleBody": "Michigan Officials: 6th Fatality Linked To Eastern Equine Encephalitis Reported\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:45 am\nFiled Under: Eastern Equine Encephalitis , EEE , health , Michigan , mosquito-borne virus\nST.

In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,\u201d said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet but it could make its ASEAN debut at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show. But will we still call it the Sylphy once it arrives here? Let's wait and see.\n"}, "06e5123e4ef7cfb4533250dc45d1e03d0838fc66223f45c583c4d12f48b4da85": {"articleBody": "November 18, 2019 11:03 PM\nAbove: A WeWork coworking space in San Francisco.\nImage Credit: WeWork\n(Reuters) \u2014 The New York State Attorney General (NYAG) is investigating WeWork, according to two people familiar with the matter, adding to a mounting series of problems that have turned the workspace provider from a Wall Street darling into a pariah in a matter of weeks.\nThe company, which is expected to lay off thousands of employees beginning this week as it faces ballooning losses, confirmed on Monday that it had been contacted by the office of the NYAG, Letitia James.\n\u201cWe received an inquiry from the office of the New York State Attorney General and are cooperating in the matter,\u201d said a WeWork spokesperson when contacted by Reuters.\nA spokesperson for the NYAG declined to comment.\nAmong the issues the NYAG is examining is whether WeWork\u2019s founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, indulged in self-dealing to enrich himself.\nNeumann bought properties that he then leased back to WeWork, borrowed against his own stake in the company, and had also planned to charge WeWork almost $6 million to use his trademark of the word \u201cWe\u201d after the company rebranded itself The We Company.\nThe company shelved its plans for an initial public offering on September 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, its business model, and its corporate governance.\nNeumann had resigned as CEO the previous week.

During that time, the officers should have conducted\u00a0five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,\u201d Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cInstead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.\u201d\nEach defendant is\u00a0charged with one count of conspiring to\u00a0falsify records. Noel, 31,\u00a0is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty\u00a0in Manhattan federal court\u00a0Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated\u00a0his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and\u00a0ordered\u00a0multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide,\u00a0focusing on\u00a0operations at the Manhattan\u00a0facility where Epstein was held.\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before\u00a0Congress\nAs\u00a0the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer\u00a0testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of\u00a0how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at\u00a0his homes\u00a0in Manhattan and\u00a0Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations\u00a0from at least 2002 to 2005.\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they\u2019re not the end of this.\n\"These guards aren\u2019t the only ones who should stand trial \u2013\u00a0every one of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,\u201d Sasse said.\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports\u00a0anything other than suicide.\nInternal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\nInvestigators\u00a0focused on how Epstein had the\u00a0opportunity to hang himself\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein\u00a0hanged himself with a bedsheet, his\u00a0death was\u00a0shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\nFor months, federal authorities examined\u00a0the conduct of the staffers assigned to\u00a0Epstein's unit and how he\u00a0escaped notice.\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters\u2019 questions.\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. \u201cIt is our hope that we\u2019ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,\u201d said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would \u201cruin his life.\u201d\n\u201cWe had hoped that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,\u201d Figgins said.\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they\u2019re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they\u2019re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?\u201d\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died.\u00a0\u201cWhen all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you\u2019ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.\u201d\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\nPrison union\u00a0representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and\u00a0compromised\u00a0security at the Manhattan facility.\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff\u00a0vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union.\u00a0Prison officials\u00a0regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m.\u00a0shift, the one on which\u00a0Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records.\u00a0On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr\u00a0reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and\u00a0prison officials placed Noel and Thomas\u00a0on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records,\u00a0had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\nAfter the hearing,\u00a0Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public\u2019s trust in us.\u201d\nEpstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\nThis March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\nNew  York State Sex Offender Registry via AP\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring\u00a0 days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\nExperts on jail suicide\u00a0told USA TODAY that an inmate can\u00a0be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate\u00a0is no\u00a0longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\u201cWhen removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he\u00a0experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\u201cForty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.\u201d\nContributing: Kristine Phillips\n"}, "7de5241947a5f7147fe9787c6f6fa16685bfe66e6c35510a68780f27690dc4f0": {"articleBody": "Thousands of teachers pack Indiana Statehouse for protest\nTom Davies Associated Press\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\nIndianapolis \u2013 Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the Republican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half of the state\u2019s school districts for the day.\nThe union-organized rally represented Indiana\u2019s biggest such teacher protest amid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.\nIndiana teachers wearing red have carry signs as they hold rally at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, calling for further increasing teacher pay in the biggest such protest in the state amid a wave of educator activism across the country.\nMichael Conroy, AP\nTeachers chanted, \u201cFund our schools,\u201d and \u201cPut kids first,\u201d as hundreds of them lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with sayings such as, \u201cLess Money on Testing, More Money on Students.\u201d Teachers with marching band instruments played \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d from the Statehouse steps.\nHigh school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow teachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m. for the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n\u201cWe need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren\u2019t paid enough.\u201d\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state\u2019s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\u201cThe crisis is now, and we need action now,\u201d Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. \u201cThe issue is funding, and the state has the money.\u201d\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn\u2019t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don\u2019t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, \u201cRed for Ed,\u201d in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state\u2019s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring \u2013 one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n\u201cWe get that you\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Bosma said. \u201cWe get that you are concerned about issues.\u201d\nTeachers didn\u2019t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb\u2019s 2016 election campaign.\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state\u2019s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren\u2019t \u201casking for the moon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,\u201d she said.\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana\u2019s Richmond High School, said politicians have \u201cvilified\u201d educators.\n\u201cThey think they know better about education than us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we\u2019re in the classroom.\u201d\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n"}, "05844573ca7e1fba714d715bb11ca08c26e25328999c74a1cb3bc8a0e4399f0f": {"articleBody": "Close\nImage 1 of 23\nKarma Automotive Andreas Thurner, Vice President for Global Design and Architecture, left, and Todd George, VP of Platform Engineering at Karma Automotive, unveil Karman Vision SC2 concept vehicle at Automobility LA Auto Show in Los Angeles Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019. less\nKarma Automotive Andreas Thurner, Vice President for Global Design and Architecture, left, and Todd George, VP of Platform Engineering at Karma Automotive, unveil Karman Vision SC2 concept vehicle at ... more\nPhoto: Damian Dovarganes, AP\nNew SUVs and electric vehicles highlight L.A. Auto Show\n1 / 23\nBack to Gallery\nNew electric vehicles, several new small SUVs, a redesigned compact car, a plug-in version of Toyota\u2019s top-selling vehicle and a futuristic electric station wagon concept car from Volkswagen are among the new models on display this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\nToyota is displaying a rechargeable hybrid version of the RAV4 \u2014 the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that\u2019s not a pickup truck \u2014 while Ford is rolling out an all-new electric SUV that carries the Mustang performance car brand name. There also is a redesigned compact Sentra from Nissan.\nThe show opens to the public on Friday. Here are some of the highlights:\nNISSAN SENTRA\nNissan is hoping a sleek redesign of the Sentra compact sedan will pull in more buyers in a struggling segment of the U.S. market.\nThe 2020 Sentra, which goes on sale in late January, loses the old version\u2019s upright econobox look. It\u2019s built on new underpinnings that lower it two inches and make it two inches wider than the outgoing model. It\u2019s got a coupe look that mimics the design of newer Nissan models like the Altima and Maxima. The new version gets a new 149 horsepower, 2-liter four-cylinder engine that\u2019s 20% more powerful than the current model, yet Nissan says it will offer better gas mileage. It also gets a new rear suspension and steering system to improve handling. Even though it\u2019s an entry-level car, it comes standard with six safety systems including automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Price and gas mileage were not announced.\nVOLKSWAGEN ID. SPACE VIZZION CONCEPT\nVolkswagen is giving us a glimpse into the car of the future with a low-slung electric station wagon called the ID. Space Vizzion Concept.\nThe German automaker, which has focused on electric vehicles after its diesel emissions-cheating scandal, says the wagon will be able to go 300 miles on a single battery charge. It has a rear-mounted 275-horsepower motor, but a second motor could be installed for all-wheel-drive, giving the car 355 horsepower. The all-wheel-drive version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in five seconds, Volkswagen says. To limit wind drag, the car has touch surfaces on the doors in place of conventional door handles. An augmented reality 15.6-inch touch screen that appears to float in the air has all entertainment, climate control and online information. VW says the car is a preview of a production vehicle for North America and Europe, but it didn\u2019t say when the wagon will go on sale.\nFORD MUSTANG MACH E\nFord will display its first all-electric SUV, marking the start of an avalanche of battery-powered vehicles coming from mainstream and luxury automakers during the next two years that industry analysts say will boost electric vehicle sales.\nAnalysts expect the number of electric vehicles for sale in the U.S. to grow from 16 currently to as many as 80 by 2022. They say the increased selection and longer range of the new vehicles will make them more popular.\nFord\u2019s Mustang Mach E SUV will go 230 miles to more 300 miles per charge depending on how it\u2019s equipped. It will start at $44,000, not including a $7,500 federal tax credit.\nThe car gets some Mustang styling cues including triple taillights, a fastback rear and a long hood. A performance GT version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in about 3.5 seconds.\nThe Mach E was unveiled Sunday night ahead of the Los Angeles show.\nTOYOTA RAV4 PRIME\nToyota is rolling out a plug-in electric version of the popular RAV4 small SUV that\u2019s more efficient and faster than the current versions.\nThe 2021 RAV4 Prime will be able to go 39 miles (63 kilometers) on battery power alone before the gas-electric hybrid propulsion system kicks in. It will get the equivalent of 90 miles per gallon (38 kilometers per liter) of gasoline, according to Toyota. Yet the 302-horsepower system will take the car from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in 5.8 seconds \u2014 a full two seconds faster than the current RAV4 Hybrid. The SUV, which is the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isn\u2019t a pickup truck, has a tuned-up version of the RAV4 Hybrid\u2019s 176 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine powering the front wheels. A separate rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels when needed. Toyota says the battery is mounted under the floor, giving the SUV a lower center of gravity and improving its handling. The RAV4 Prime goes on sale in the summer. The price wasn\u2019t announced.\nMost Popular\n"}, "b6fb53e9fb043c98eb1e6530a1074c40922e29025f5454809f3938a7c174faa3": {"articleBody": "Cartoni\n02 Ago 2017\nE\u2019 stato annunciato in queste ore che Netflix, il servizio di streaming a pagamento, ospiter\u00e0 il remake in computer grafica della serie animata cult degli anni \u201980 \u201cI Cavalieri dello Zodiaco\u201c, prodotta da Toei Animation sulla base del manga originale di Masami Kurumada.\nGli appassionati di \u201cSaint Seiya\u201d sono gi\u00e0 sul piede di guerra, dopo il primo esperimento, pietoso sotto tutti i punti di vista, de \u201cLa leggenda del Grande Tempio\u201d, datato 2014.

The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is Google's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google\u2019s planned 'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community...and that should seed interest in the Founder\u2019s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there\u2019s a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don\u2019t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We\u2019re excited by the opportunity and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\"\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you\u2019re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we\u2019re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that\u2019s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we'd look at.\"\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward.\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you\u2019ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You\u2019ll never download a game or have to download an update.\u00a0We\u2019re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven\u2019t seen it in games yet.\u00a0It\u2019s tough to go back to console.\"\n"}, "5caf91b8a4423735f866b089d2611ea14503584cf3b6f487c6d26eb7b9521fca": {"articleBody": "The Latest: Man stabbed to death on San Francisco Bay train\nUpdated\n10:01\u00a0pm PST, Tuesday, November 19, 2019\nHAYWARD, Calif.

Designed specifically for Intensive Care Units and released by Ascom, this innovative solution helps healthcare professionals gain instant visibility to patient status.\nBAAR, SWITZERLAND\nBased on Ascom\u2019s connectivity, clinical workflow and mobility expertise, the Digistat Patient Watch solution provides clinicians throughout Europe with an innovative solution to address the needs of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This partnership further expands the existing global relationship between GE and Ascom.\nIn traditional ICUs, each patient is wired to up to ten medical equipment \u2013 from monitoring devices to ventilators or infusion pumps. These high-end technologies provide clinicians with critical information and alert them when staff intervention is required. But this can sometimes lead to alarm fatigue, with care givers being exposed to up to 1,000 alarms per shift[1], even though up to 99% of those do not even require clinical intervention[2].\nThe new alarm management solution called Digistat Patient Watch, collects data from a variety of devices connected to the patient providing a holistic view at the patient bedside level and at the ICU level. Clinicians gain visibility on patient status, highlighting alarms and warnings occurring on any connected device. This critical data can also be displayed on a handheld mobile device, such as the Ascom Myco 2 which is designed specifically for clinical staff. The benefits for healthcare professionals may include helping improve staff efficiency, supporting better organization of patient care and implementing procedures to reduce the number of alarms.\n\u201cDigistat Patient Watch helps clinicians leverage patient data to increase situational awareness and align priorities. It has the potential to change their practice and improve workflow efficiency\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Neu, Head of Platform Solutions for Ascom.\n\u201cDigistat Patient Watch is an important addition to GE Healthcare\u2019s portfolio of solutions for the Intensive Care, and we are delighted with this expanded collaboration with Ascom\u201d, adds Olivier Bosc, General Manager of Life Care Solutions Europe at GE Healthcare.\nFor more information on the Digistat Patient Watch solution, as well as on Ascom\u2019s innovative clinical care solutions, please visit: www.ascom.com\n[1] Alarm fatigue: impacts on patient safety, Ruskin KJ, Hueske-Kraus D.

There is a correlation between the perceived decline in Apple\u2019s focus on Macs and consumer\u2019s needs, wants and desires, with the design direction that was taken in the 2016-2019 MacBook Pro, the lack of substantive updates to the Mac mini and the 2013 MacPro, as well as the hoopla over Jony Ive\u2019s outside projects and dare I say it, weight gain, that leads me to believe that he was Ready to leave Apple back in 2015 after the Watch was released or even earlier and maybe he is or was suffering from some form of depression.\nAgain, this is conjecture on my part, I have no insider knowledge and only a few links to back up my assertions. But I\u2019ve seen and lived parts of this before in my professional life. I suspect Ive was incredibly frustrated with Cook\u2019s focus on costs, margin, supply chain, moving away from computers (although I think Ive was with him on that) and Cook\u2019s relative lack of Deep caring or interest in the process of design, aesthetics, elegance...and that lead to a fractious working relationship. Steve balanced them out, acted as a buffer and took on the responsibility of making the final decisions, although I think he favored Ive\u2019s arguments more times than anyone would admit. So to keep Cook, Jobs made him CEO and to balance it out, elevated Ive to CDO and gave him almost co-equal CEO power.\nThese sorts or working relationships are fragile, egocentric, mercurial and not prone to longevity. Ive no longer wants to be held back and these external projects were to try and give him a chance to spread his wings while retaining him as long as possible. The past 4-8 years are a result of this, I believe, we just have no transparency into any of Apple\u2019s corporate drama.\nAgain, my opinion, my conjecture, my experiences. Thanks for letting me ramble on.\n[automerge]1574096160[/automerge]\nI sure wish Apple would offer the opportunity to upgrade the keyboards from the 2018 models to the new keyboard.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer considers settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but the Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\nHighlights\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\nThe United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement.\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel.\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body.\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added.\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees.\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\".\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel.\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us.

It later reverted to the name \u201cCCHQ Press\u201d and restored the party logo to its profile.\nOrganizations that seek to combat political misinformation cried foul.\n\u201cIt was an attempt to mislead voters,\u2019\u2019 Will Moy, chief executive of the London-based fact-checking website Full Fact, told the BBC. \u201cAnd I think it is inappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that way.\u201d\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party\u2019s actions, saying the Twitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives.\n\u201cWe make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and lies put out,\u201d Raab told the BBC.\nTwitter pledged to take \u201cdecisive corrective action\u201d against similar strategies in the future. But the manipulation of the account in a high-profile event put the issue of the rise of digital campaigning squarely in the public eye.\nAll political parties are devoting much of their campaign spending to the digital realm as they battle to win the U.K.\u2019s Dec. 12 election.\nDespite parliamentary reports urging new regulations to combat misinformation or regulate the way digital ads are targeted at voters, officials in Britain have made no significant changes to laws governing online ads, social media and election disinformation.\nIn a reflection of the confusion, the Electoral Commission, which regulates campaign finances, issued a statement warning that \u201cvoters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election.\u2019\u2019 Critically, however, it pointed out that it doesn\u2019t have \u201ca role in regulating election campaign content.\u2019\u2019\nWith the absence of law, campaigns have already been pressing the boundaries to get attention. The Conservative Party became embroiled in controversy earlier this month when it posted a video on social media containing a misleading edit of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour Party figure. The video had been altered to show Starmer failing to answer a question about Brexit, when, in fact, he responded quickly. The chairman of the Conservative Party described the doctored video as lighthearted satire.\nIn their first TV debate of the election on Tuesday, Johnson and Corbyn attacked each other\u2019s policies on Brexit, health care and the economy.\nBut the debate likely failed to answer the question that has dogged the campaign: Who can voters trust? The two leaders sidestepped tricky questions about their own policies in the hourlong encounter and drew derisive laughter from the studio audience at several points.\nBoth Johnson and Corbyn are trying to overcome a mountain of mistrust as they try to win over a Brexit-weary electorate.\nJohnson is under fire for failing to deliver on his often-repeated vow that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31.\nAudience members laughed when he urged voters, \u201cLook what I have said I\u2019m going to do as a politician and look what I\u2019ve delivered.\u201d\nCorbyn, a stolid socialist, is accused by critics of promoting high-tax policies and of failing to clamp down on anti-Semitism within his party. His refusal to say which side he would be on in a Brexit referendum was also met with hoots of laughter.\nTelevised debates are a relatively new phenomenon in British elections \u2014 the first took place in 2010 \u2014 and they have the power to transform campaigns. A confident 2010 appearance by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked a wave of \u201cCleggmania\u201d that helped to propel him into the deputy prime minister post in a coalition government with the Conservatives.

Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for \u2014 but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n2. Take inventory\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the\u00a0Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\u00a0\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should\u00a0calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your\u00a0annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3. Establish your target number\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\u00a0\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal \u2014 and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n\u00a0\n4. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American.\u00a0By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n5. Leverage your income\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort \u2014 it's a short-term solution \u2014 whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions \u2014 not including any earnings \u2014 tax-free, at any time.\n7. Invest the money that's left over\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\nNeed help crunching the numbers?

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\nTommy \u2014 who only goes by his first name online \u2014 retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n9. Research your options for health insurance\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance \u2014 if available to you \u2014 is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n10. Make a backup plan\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement \u2014 would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it \u2014 would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\u00a0\n11. Put Plan A into action \u2014 but enjoy the present, too\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\nRelated coverage from\u00a0How to Do Everything: Money:\n\n\nHere's exactly how to figure out when you can retire\n\n\nHow to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth\n\n\nHow to get COBRA health insurance if you lose your job or retire early\n\n\nHow to invest in index funds, explained\ninternational\n"}, "dfd43bc0d46e7aaa78ba10fbcb5b9fdfe78771d36cb4c7497e17fb6f69170ec5": {"articleBody": "Our BI Research Shows \u2013 A Mix of Native Ad Units Generate the Highest Engagement Metrics for Marketers and the Greatest Revenue for Publishers\nFebruary 15, 2018\nThough recommendation widgets are the most popular type of native ad units and generate the greatest revenue, optimal native ad performance on both the demand and supply side is achieved by running the range of native ad units.\nNew York, NY \u2013 \u00a0The range of native ad units now available have powered native ad spending past all other forms of display advertising in 2017, according to analysis from Poynter.\nBut are all native ads equal for marketers and publishers?\nTo answer this question and gain a greater understanding of the range of native ad units, the my6sense data analytics team analyzed billions of recommendation widget, in-feed and in-ad native ad units served via my6sense\u2019s white label programmatic native ad platform in the last 6 months of 2017.\nOn the\u00a0supply side, recommendation widgets are the most profitable among the native ad units, followed closely by in-feed ad units, which are 20% less profitable than recommendation widgets. Recommendation widgets provide publishers with an\neffective way to recirculate organic content which increases publisher engagement metrics including time spent and pages viewed while also generating revenue from the additional ads viewed. In-feed ads earn the highest revenue per ad but generate a lower RPM (Revenue Per Thousand) for publishers since recommendation widgets include multiple ads in the same ad unit.\nIn-feed units provide the supply side with a new revenue stream when they appear within content lists and articles. Among the three primary native ad units, in-ad units generate about one quarter of the revenue of recommendation widgets, yet are quick and easy to implement at scale on standard banner placements with no required layout changes, while they outperform traditional banner ads from both revenue and user experience perspectives.\nOn the demand side, in-feed ads generate the highest CTR and user engagement, 2.5 times greater than ads in recommendation widgets and about 10 times higher than ads within in-ad units. The ratio was similar when comparing effective CPMs for paid ad items across these three types of native ad units.\nThe strong performance of in-feed ads for brand campaigns is the result of the exclusive presence they receive as the only ad in view with larger images and longer texts, resulting in higher engagement rates. While in-feed ads dominate for branding campaigns, recommendation widgets and in-ad units, which are more cost-effective, perform better for direct response campaigns.\nThough each of the three native ad units is unique, the best performing native ad campaigns for advertisers are those running with optimized A/B creatives in recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad units combined. And on the supply side, the combination of all three ad units results in the greatest revenue rates for publishers.\n\u201cIn the same way Olympic champions utilize a broad range of training activities to achieve peak performance, my6sense marketers achieving the highest engagement rates and publishers generate the greatest revenue by running all three native ad units in parallel \u2013 recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad,\u201d said Avinoam Rubinstain, CEO & founder, my6sense.\nWhich native ad units are the most popular?\nRecommendation widgets are the most popular form of native ad units (38%), followed by in-feed units (30%), in-ad units (25%) and finally textual and custom designs (7%).\nDespite the smaller screen size, native ads on mobile devices generate twice the CTR of native ads on desktops, though the effective CPM is 30% lower on mobile because advertisers still pay more for desktop ads.\nmy6sense provides the only fully programmatic native exchange solution for multi-item native ad units combined with comprehensive organic content recirculation, enabling clients and partners to easily mix recommendation widgets, in-feed, in-ad units and any other custom native ad units with any number of ad items on the page.\nAbout my6sense\nmy6sense offers an open programmatic white label native advertising platform for ad networks, media trading companies, group publishers, DSPs and SSPs.

(Photo: Getty Images)\nGetty\nThe Corrs\u2019 song \u201cBreathless\u201d probably doesn\u2019t refer to a duvet. However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports .\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn\u2019t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn\u2019t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: \u201cTwo months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30\u2009min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).\u201d\nAt first glance, the man didn\u2019t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn\u2019t a smoker. His workplace didn\u2019t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently \u201cacquired\u201d both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.\nBreathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren\u2019t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\nA CT of his chest showed a \u201cground glass\u201d pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called \u201cfeather duvet lung.\u201d When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is \u201cbird fancier\u2019s lung.\u201d When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called \u201cpigeon breeder\u2019s lung.\u201d If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn\u2019t occur often enough to have its own name.\nWait there\u2019s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what\u2019s called \u201cfarmer's lung,\u201d not to be confused with a farmer\u2019s tan. \u201cHumidifier lung\u201d may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is \u201chot tub lung,\u201d which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn\u2019t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it\u2019s not always good if what\u2019s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)\nGetty\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids \u201chad a transformative effect within 2\u2009days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.\u201d\nEventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, \u201cthe course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%\u201398%\u2009which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn\u2019t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\u201d\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it\u2019s not someone you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it\u2019s the pigeons that you are breeding in your kitchen.\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like \u201cfeather duvet lung\u201d are still relatively uncommon. That\u2019s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the slightest touch and you feel weak.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology .\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter , gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .\nRelated: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through Time\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project , which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement . \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes . When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\nRelated: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n"}, "e1c7023ee2148901b086256fdd30a0893d10b0720b510d5ff07a021109347266": {"articleBody": "by European Space Agency\nOnce the preserve of science fiction, through films such as Alien (pictured) and 2001: A Space Odyssey, hibernation or\u00a0\u2018suspended animation\u2019 may one day become an important enabler of deep space travel. Credit: 20th Century Fox\nIf a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted with hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Event Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into \"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated how real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.\nHuman hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the Discovery element of ESA's Basic Activities, then recommended as a key \"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency's Future Technology Advisory Panel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\nNow the Agency's SciSpacE team has called in ESA's Concurrent Design Facility\u2014a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial evaluations of proposed future missions\u2014to assess the advantages of human hibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human hibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the CDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of hibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an existing mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year timescale.\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics, protection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\" comments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\nA reference habitation module for a crewed Mars mission compared to its hibernation-based equivalent. Credit: ESA\n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what to do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact hibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an initial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a validated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing the crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to several tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual pods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"\u2014the term for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would be expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell pods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their occupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise.\nThe hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation period\u2014although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation would be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\nFunctional areas of the hibernation module: (1) private crew quarters, (2) exercise, (3) hygiene and waste, (4) dining and wardroom, (5) workstation, (6) galley and food, (7) medical supplies, (8) life support systems and stowage, (9) operational and maintenance supplies.\u00a0In general, the habitat is divided into two zones of habitable volumes: the crew quarters which are used during the entire mission duration, and the volumes for wardroom and workstation, food preparation and eating, waste collection and hygiene, exercise, medical, operational and maintenance purposes that are only used during the time the crew is awake and active.

The pods would also be well shielded against radiation.\u00a0(1) private crew quarters, (8) life support system and stowage, (10) circulation space. Credit: ESA\nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space travel , but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in their hibernation pods, then shielding\u2014such as water containers\u2014could be concentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it gives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission would have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use of artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to maintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be revived.\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for human space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we were able to reduce an astronaut's basic metabolic rate by 75% \u2013 similar to what we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain bears\u2014we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-duration exploration missions more feasible.\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is actually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied as therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major surgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols for inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically gain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are activated or blocked during initiation of hibernation , starting with animals and proceeding to people.\"\nExplore further\n"}, "5a822960e9a2cb1e664d334b6c936c5cb6e41fb5331877538c2c8339cb59d57e": {"articleBody": "House Hitler was born in will become a police station, Austria says\nThe government's move aims to prevent building from becoming a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis.\nThe house where Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria.Leonhard Foeger / Reuters file\nBreaking News Emails\nNov. 20, 2019, 9:28 AM UTC\nBy Reuters\nVIENNA \u2014 The house where Adolf Hitler was born will be turned into a police station, Austria's interior minister said on Tuesday, after years of debate over how best to prevent it becoming a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis.\nHaving recently carried out a compulsory purchase of the house in Braunau am Inn , a town on the border with Germany, Austria will invite architects to submit plans for a redesign of the building.

Here\u2019s what he had to say\u2026\nQ: Junior \u2013 We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\nA: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\nQ: What\u2019s the one thing you\u2019ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you\u2019re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\nQ: How do you prioritize your day?\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey\u2019s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits \u2013 \u201cPut first things first\u201d, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I\u2019m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.\nThe best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn\u2019t ask for better of either.  Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I\u2019m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry.  Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.\nQ: What\u2019s on the horizon for the business?\nA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we\u2019ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\nQ: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but the need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees, clients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct approach.\nQ: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you\u2019ve been named a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What\u2019s it like to be named a 40 Under 40?\nA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It\u2019s a very prestigious group of folks this year \u2013 and in years past \u2013 and I am so appreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I work with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I share this recognition with the entire Experience team.\nOk, now for a little fun.\nQ: Where did you grow up?\nA: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 the most beautiful 87 square miles in the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\nQ: Favorite childhood memory?\nA: Trip to Disney World\nQ: Favorite apps?\nA: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile\nQ: Favorite artists or groups?\nA: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\nQ: Favorite books?\nA: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\nQ: Favorite live event you\u2019ve ever attended?\nA: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record breaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely rocking!\nQ: Favorite athlete?\nQ: Favorite places you have visited?\nA: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\nQ: Most memorable live event experience?\nA: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50 plus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma City Thunder \u2013 AND, seeing Adele live in concert \u2013 she brought the house down!\nQ: What are your hobbies?\nA: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my family.\nQ: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years\nA: Sonos \u2013 Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your house with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it in an incredibly simple way.\nThanks Junior!\n"}, "c50845a7158af12ee75acea301a3ea0dad1e848d6b9dbdb43ba7f2d825b2528b": {"articleBody": "Spaceflight\nShares\nNASA has recruited SpaceX's Starship, Blue Origin's Blue Moon and three other commercial lunar lander ideas to join its Arte mis m oon program .\nToday (Nov. 18), NASA announced the selection of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. to join its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program (CLPS). The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement . \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018 , bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\nThe newly selected five are:\nImage 1 of 5\nNASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help return astronauts to the moon in 2024.\n(Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)\nImage 2 of 5\nAn artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.\n(Image credit: Blue Origin)\nImage 3 of 5\nThis Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's commercial lunar lander for NASA.\n(Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)\nImage 4 of 5\nAn artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the moon's surface.\n(Image credit: Ceres Robotics)\nThis illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.\n(Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)\nBlue Origin, Kent, Washington\nCeres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\nSierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\nSpaceX, Hawthorne, California\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly massive \u2014 SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle \u2014 to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we\u2019ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle , which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres\u00a0Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool \u2014 to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n"}, "287e4d9f4af31733aad6534aefb2bd00fb344ec8d6ebf1ac99dbc4d762da0ca4": {"articleBody": "Daily Deals: More Black Friday Deals Are Live, Including PS4 DualShock Controller, Apple AirPods and Watches, and More\nBlack Friday is Next Week, But Several Deals Go Live Today\nBy Eric Song , IGN Staff\nUpdated: 18 Nov 2019 9:38 pm\nPosted: 18 Nov 2019 8:11 pm\nWant more deals? Join the IGN Deals Newsletter.\nWelcome to IGN's Daily Deals, your source for the best deals on the stuff you actually want to buy. Follow us at Twitter @igndeals .\nWe bring you the best deals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of random stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is approaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black Friday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\nPS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\nGet it on Amazon for 39.99\nNintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even on Black Friday).\nGet it at Walmart for $238.99\nKing of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R Curved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming monitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely love it, both for work and for games.\nGet it on Amazon for $649.99\nNew Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99 (Originally $200)\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most people probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\nAlso at Walmart\nNew Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped today to the lowest price we've ever seen.\nAlso at Walmart\n45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift card, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're essentially getting it for $499.\nDell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD for $799.99\nUse code \"50OFF699\"\nThis is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\nNetgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\nClip the $10 off coupon on the product page\nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\nGet Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\nThis sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to uncover your login info one day\u2014and if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019 . Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\nDownload Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don't have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\nGet 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n$10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\nGet it at Walmart for $249.95\nNew Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with Bonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\nGet it by itself on Amazon for $199\nNew Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon Credit\n\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review .\nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but we confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it will end very, very soon so hurry!\nGet Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday season.  This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\nGet it at Walmart for $499.99\n$15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\nGet it on Amazon for $234.98\n30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City 2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.\nGet it on Amazon for $243.97\nDisney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package and Save $5/Month\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription.

Afterwards you'll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you're in it for the long haul, then you can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.\nAn even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle . In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee services separately, you'd be paying around $17.99 per month, so you'd be saving $60 every year.\nNote: The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-free Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle plan. Here's the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the Disney+ bundled package:\nSign up for a Hulu ad-free account for $11.99 a month\nIf you already have a Hulu account, visit your account page to upgrade\nSign up for the Disney+ bundle using the same email as your Hulu account\n______________________________\nEric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts.\nIf you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

It\u2019s part of a larger pollution problem in India.\nSanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nAnother cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million residents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is likely to reach \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cemergency\u201d levels on Wednesday. The dangerous, dirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over India\u2019s capital region.\nIt\u2019s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhi\u2019s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as a \u201cgas chamber.\u201d\nDelhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states\nIt is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today\nI urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights , closed schools , and created a public health emergency . The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren .\nLast week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day . The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of \u201chazardous.\u201d\nAir pollution in Delhi remains \u201cunhealthy\u201d this week.\nBerkeley Earth\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it\u2019s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India . The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 \u2014 particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems \u2014 were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths . Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure . With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities , the risk is worsening for Indians.\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.\nWhy Delhi\u2019s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, there\u2019s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi\u2019s more than 10 million vehicles , like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors.  Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region\u2019s total pollution. Dust from the city\u2019s construction boom is also a contributor to the city\u2019s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation .\nThese sources contribute to Delhi\u2019s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now.\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n\u2014 Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi\u2019s pollution right now isn\u2019t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that\u2019s plugged up,\u201d Apte said. \u201cIt overflows with spectacular consequences.\u201d\nDelhi\u2019s air wasn\u2019t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,\u201d said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. \u201cThe [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?\u201d\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India\u2019s breadbasket , and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality.\nSakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act .\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab\u2019s water table . But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat , which is typically sown mid-November.\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can\u2019t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting \u2014 burning crop stubble.\nThis satellite image from NASA\u2019s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.\nNASA Worldview\nOf course, it\u2019s not just rural pollution that\u2019s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution \u2014 traffic, construction, cooking fires \u2014 have also increased as the region\u2019s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued , showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it\u2019s because of shifts in the weather \u2014 not policy.\n\u201cThis is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi\u2019s air to slightly improve,\u201d Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News .\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.\nSonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. \u201cPart of the challenge is that there\u2019s a character of \u2018Oh no, you first,\u2019 \u2018No, you first,\u2019\u201d Apte said. \u201cNo one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.\u201d\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution \u2014 many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds .\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India\u2019s last election cycle . And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\u201cPeople will be up in revolt, they\u2019ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.\u201d\nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve . Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\nEcological Economics\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China\u2019s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics , it gets done.  The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\u201cThe beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cNothing stands between the decision and the implementation.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. \u201cIf one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,\u201d Prakash said. It\u2019s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\nBiplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan , and Lagos, Nigeria . \u201cThe problem can be solved,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cBut what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.\u201d\n"}, "8e3efab59f48fd29a1e1e7aa135880c4251a9f090f94999668cdbaec59d30b5a": {"articleBody": "What\u2019s he supposed to say?\n6ringsandarapist says:\nDid anyone really think the Chargers would win?\nlonespeed says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\nPhilip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback.

Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this honey pear jam recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It\u2019s so easy and delicious that you\u2019ll want to make some extra for yourself!\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially homemade jam. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone\u2019s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it\u2019s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment.\nWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don\u2019t know. Help!\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars ), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason\u00a0jars.\nMAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor\u00ae Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar .\u00a0Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor\u00ae Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\nHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don\u2019t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully.\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don\u2019t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam.\nGIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it\u2019s sure to be a winner.\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\nUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar.\u00a0In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey.\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.\nSpiced Honey Pear Jam\n"}, "57e2e98887a1965689955921208e32f410b10e2b95c907e74e57982d3edf3cc6": {"articleBody": "Native Ad Platform my6sense Names Mobile Marketing Pioneer Ivan Braiker Chief Strategy Officer\nJuly 2, 2018\nNew York, NY \u2013 With content engagement migrating from desktop to mobile devices, my6sense, a comprehensive, white label programmatic native ad platform and exchange, is adding mobile marketing pioneer Ivan Braiker as the company\u2019s first Chief Strategy Officer.\nIvan served as the CEO of Hipcricket, a mobile marketing company which innovated mobile messaging as a marketing vehicle, from 2004 \u2013 2014, achieving a successful exit for the company\u2019s investors by selling Hipcricket to Augme Technologies in 2011.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\nIt\u2019s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it\u2019s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\nWhere it\u2019s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\nFallen Order\u2019s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game\u2019s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era\u2019s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\nOne of the narrative\u2019s strongest elements is that it doesn\u2019t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There\u2019s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn\u2019t matter to the general story.\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez\u2019s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year\u2019s best new character.\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction \u2013 and my god, every little animation he plays \u2013 both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2\u2019s BT-7274.\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn\u2019t so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\nThis means you\u2019ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn\u2019t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don\u2019t always need to follow the quest marker if you don\u2019t want to.\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it\u2019s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It\u2019s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware\u2019s work, which is what makes the map \u2013 available to you at any point \u2013 such a lifesaver.\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren\u2019t. They\u2019re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It\u2019s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake\u2019s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn\u2019t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\nIn your adventures, you\u2019ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they\u2019re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however \u2013 units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they\u2019re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\nThe best new character in 2019.\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\nYou\u2019re going to parry the basic trooper\u2019s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You\u2019ll watch for the melee trooper\u2019s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you\u2019ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you\u2019ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you\u2019re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\nFallen Order\u2019s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don\u2019t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you\u2019ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It\u2019s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution.\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you\u2019ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it\u2019s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There\u2019s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents\u2019 guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry.\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can\u2019t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don\u2019t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They\u2019ll often continue their combo unabated and you\u2019ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren\u2019t working.\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn\u2019t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack.\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could\u2019ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn\u2019t hook me.\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all \u2013 at the game\u2019s worst moments \u2013 lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually \u2013 but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren\u2019t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I\u2019ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don\u2019t always win.\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting \u2013 but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\nAnd yes, it doesn\u2019t always get there in this one, but damn If I can\u2019t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It\u2019s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn\u2019t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent \u2013 albeit flawed \u2013 combat.\nVersion tested: PC.\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted \u201ctechnical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays \u201d. The report and Monday\u2019s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency\u2019s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\nIn May, NASA\u2019s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, as NASA\u2019s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon\u2019s icy crust.\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\nCloser to home, NASA\u2019s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth\u2019s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year\u2019s original list.\n\u201cWe\u2019re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,\u201d said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting times. We\u2019re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.\u201d\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\u201cSpace exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,\u201d said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\u201cThere are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.\u201d\nSOURCE: Al Jazeera News\n"}, "5f03fc173ebc6abdfae50b96ce0b05a6137b7d3f2ef379be35a9bb8ca9f49e87": {"articleBody": "Drink

The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.\nModule efficiency\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power . Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.\nDomestic industry\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency\u2019s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n"}, "14cc2a0ca59c62a8c9f205a171e9ccf4ef4cf69b0c642f51c8c65c051b39024f": {"articleBody": "NASA Just Confirmed There Are Water Plumes Above The Surface of Jupiter's Moon Europa\nVICTOR TANGERMANN, FUTURISM\n18 NOV 2019\nA team led by researchers out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has confirmed traces of water vapor above the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa.\nAnd that's a big deal as the tiny space rock is one of the highest priority targets in NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, according to the agency.\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" lead researcher and NASA planetary scientist Lucas Paganini said in a NASA statement .\nAccording to a paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Monday, the NASA team discovered enough water vapor being released from Europa to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\nBut while that sounds like a lot, it was only just enough to be detected from Earth.\nOut of 17 observations by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a spectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres by scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only spotted water vapor in one.\n\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower levels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger activity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.\nFor many years, scientists have suspected that there's water on Europa's surface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.\nMore than two decades ago, NASA's Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an electrically conductive fluid on the moon's surface.

James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score.\n\u201cCoach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,\u201d James said. \u201cI really don't know what to think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad it happened in a win.\u201d\nLos Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.\nPhoto: Ringo H.W.

Chiu, AP\nLeBron sets triple-double mark, Lakers hold off OKC 112-107\n1 / 4\nBack to Gallery\nJames has five triple-doubles in the Lakers\u2019 last 10 games, getting four in victories. There\u2019s a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career.\nVogel has put the ball in James\u2019 hands constantly on offense, and his playmaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they demonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron\u2019s assists came on baskets by Davis.\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTo be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it\u2019s) trippy that he\u2019s been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work.\u201d\nJames is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him \u2014 Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd \u2014 hadn\u2019t done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James\u2019 efforts as a tall point guard.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just playing terrific basketball,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cFor him to be doing what he\u2019s doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There\u2019s no reason to believe he can\u2019t sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push.\u201d\nDennis Schr\u00f6der scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first half for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid performances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former home arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think we did a great job on him,\u201d Schr\u00f6der said. \u201cThey obviously hit some tough shots.\u201d\nOne night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers thanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City couldn\u2019t quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close all night.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we did well in there,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cBut, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the one sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are really, really good teams, so we\u2019re competing well at a high level. But we\u2019ve just got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games.\u201d\nThe Thunder won\u2019t have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in Oklahoma City in three days.\nTIP-INS\nThunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee sprain. ... Schr\u00f6der got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting Davis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled.\nLakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion after teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an elbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with obvious damage above his eye. He didn\u2019t return to the game, although Vogel said he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within the next 24 hours.\nCLOSEOUT SEQUENCE\nJames\u2019 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder scored nine straight points to cut the Lakers\u2019 lead to two on Gallinari\u2019s free throws with 1:24 left.\nAfter Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free throws moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn\u2019t score again.\nPOINT GUARDS BEHAVE\nChris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and he didn\u2019t appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last season while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high 10 assists.\nUP NEXT\nThunder: Host the Lakers on Friday.\nLakers: Visit the Thunder on Friday.\n___\n"}, "65ce3a4577a0306994efa190a0d96e84014f9d4257ad54753e807ede518f02c0": {"articleBody": "Tuesday's college football: Eastern Michigan routs Northern Illinois to become bowl eligible\nDetroit News wire services\nPublished 11:11 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\nEastern Michigan quarterback Mike Glass III\nAl Goldis, Associated Press\nDekalb, Ill. \u2014 Mike Glass threw for three touchdowns and ran for another and Eastern Michigan rolled past Northern Illinois, 45-17, on Tuesday night.\nThe Eagles (6-5, 3-4) snapped an 11-game losing streak to the Huskies (4-7, 3-4) dating to 2007 and ended NIU\u2019s title hopes in the Mid-American Conference West Division with one league game remaining.\nEastern Michigan also became bowl-eligible for the second straight season, a program first.\nShaq Vann rushed for 101 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries for Eastern Michigan and Arthur Jackson caught two TD passes.

It was definitely a change.\u201d\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn\u2019t exactly itching to do something else. \u201cI had been somebody who really liked music,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.\u201d\nWhen the music didn\u2019t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it \u2014 if only for her sanity \u2014 even though she didn\u2019t know how to play an instrument. \u201cI called a very talented friend of mine on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and I said: \u2018Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?\u2019\u201d she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother\u2019s name. \u201cHe wanted to work with \u2018Nellie Wall,\u2019 but then I showed up instead,\u201d she said.\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley\u2019s doorstep almost a decade later.\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper \u2014 a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of \u201cWar & Peace\u201d \u2014 had just found his next project. He\u2019d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called \u201cWild Rose,\u201d a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville\u2019s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley \u2014 who landed a key role in \u201cWar & Peace\u201d after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition \u201cI\u2019d Do Anything\u201d \u2014 had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn\u2019t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she\u2019s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details.\u00a0Phoning in from London,\u00a0Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: \u201cThe script just said something along the lines of, \u2018Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone\u2019s uplifted. The end,\u2019\u201d Harper said. \u201cI had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.\u201d Universal\u2019s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called \u201cGlasgow (\u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d). \u201cIt grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just connected.\u201d Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of \u201cFargo,\u201d had a similar experience: \u201cIt was just that immediate feeling of \u2018this is the song.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by \u201cthe Mary Steenburgen of it all.\u201d\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought \u2018Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?\u2019\u201d\nBut she also felt like she didn\u2019t have much of a choice. \u201cI was back at it by the next morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI just told myself: \u2018I\u2019m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!\u2019\u201d Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. \u201cIt could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cShe put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she\u2019s gotten really good at the accordion.\u201d\nSteenburgen\u2019s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for \u201cWild Rose\u201d were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. \u201cI fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven\u2019t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.\u201d\nThat process led to a realization: \u201cIt was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother \u2026It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn\u2019t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.\u201d\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show \u201cNashville,\u201d Steenburgen\u2019s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different muscle,\u201d York said. \u201cYou have to take yourself out of it a little bit \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like acting, I guess.\u201d Smith agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a different job altogether. If you\u2019re just writing a song for someone else, it\u2019s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you\u2019re writing for yourself, you\u2019re really digging into your own heart.\u201d This particular task was a little bit of both. \u201cI feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we\u2019ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,\u201d Smith said.\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn\u2019s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\u201cAnything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,\u201d Steenburgen said. \u201cSo I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,\u201d a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. \u201cSo I called her up and said \u2018Talk to me in your accent \u2014 talk to me about you.\u2019 And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: \u2018I\u2019ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.\u2019\u201d\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours \u2014 which, when you listen to \u201cGlasgow,\u201d seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. \u201cIt may sound shallow or like it\u2019s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,\u201d Steenburgen said, \u201cbut I always think of it like this: \u2018I can\u2019t take days to do a scene.\u2019 I can\u2019t say \u2018I don\u2019t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?\u2019 I\u2019m always having to tell stories on a time limit.\u201d Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: \u201cThey\u2019re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, \u2018Well I can\u2019t sing like that, so I\u2019m not doing that song.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWild Rose\u201d\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\nBuckley, who hadn\u2019t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like \u201cGlasgow,\u201d especially given that she had no background in country music. \u201cBut the story of it really moved me,\u201d she said, \u201cso I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.\u201d\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: \u201cIt made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character \u2014 someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman\u2019s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,\u201d she said.\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. \u201cI told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Glasgow\u2019 is a song of belonging. It\u2019s about stretching yourself to places that you don\u2019t know are within yourself.\u201d For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. \u201cThis song was such a gift to me,\u201d she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\nSteenburgen called Buckley\u2019s performance \u201cstunning,\u201d but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. \u201cMusic is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn\u2019t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.\u201d\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film\u2019s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley\u2019s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: \u201cI pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.\u201d\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It\u2019s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn\u2019s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. \u201cHad to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,\u201d she sings. \u201cAin\u2019t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that\u2019s stronger than stone.\u201d\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who\u2019s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley\u2019s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who\u2019s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: \u201cAin\u2019t no place like home,\u201d she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It\u2019s staggering.\nIt\u2019s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen\u2019s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she\u2019d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she\u2019s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fall out of love with acting when this happened,\u201d Steenburgen said, \u201cand I still haven\u2019t. But there\u2019s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don\u2019t really have to do that.\u201d\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\u201cWild Rose\u201d is now available on DVD and VOD.\nPopular on IndieWire\n"}, "f5c90a6d5253c3a21ff3168c64bea4b5ffade7a1ba5bed952a59ebee0d648d98": {"articleBody": "Follow Victor Davis Hanson on Twitter\nNovember 19, 2019 6:30 AM\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, October 31, 2019.\n(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\nTime is not on Adam Schiff\u2019s side.\nAdam Schiff\u2019s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump\u2019s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump\u2019s popularity and render him politically inert.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff\u2019s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call \u2014 Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff\u2019s own doubling-down admission that he didn\u2019t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\u201d) \u2014 he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\nAdvertisement\nSchiff\u2019s astounding assertion that he doesn\u2019t know the whistleblower\u2019s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller\u2019s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS \u2014 the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller\u2019s own appointment.\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor\u2019s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\nAdvertisement\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\nAdvertisement\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate \u201cUkrainian collusion.\u201d They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington \u201cwise man\u201d icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\nMost of Schiff\u2019s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\nAdvertisement\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the \u201creset\u201d proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\nAdvertisement\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG \u2014 but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes \u2014 to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia\u2019s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give \u201cspace\u201d to Obama before the 2012 election \u2014 with \u201cspace\u201d perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama\u2019s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity secret?\nAdvertisement\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\nAdvertisement\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\nDay-by-day Schiff\u2019s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O\u2019Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he\u2019ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier \u2014 from Bernie Sanders\u2019s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments \u2014 at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion \u2014 the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College\u2013subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine \u2014 seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, \u201cEnough already, just vote.\u201d\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, \u201cMake Trump just go away.\u201d But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\nthat\u2019s hissing and calling for more blood \u2014 up until a point.\nAdvertisement\nOnce the kings\u2019 torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling \u201cMercy!\u201d\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump\u2019s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff\u2019s prior contacts with the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him \u2014 including his own party\u2019s presidential candidates.\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump\u2019s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism.\n"},

dan\u00a0Syi\u2019ah\nPosted on Oktober 27, 2015 by Admin\nSebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena pemberontakan Mu\u2019awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi. Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi\u2019ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja.

Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi\u2019ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafi\u2019ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi\u2019ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Mu\u2019awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.\u2060\u2060\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti \u2018Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\nSyi\u2019ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syi\u2019ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\nAhmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, \u201cDari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam.

The fight for African American voters is raging. And there are growing concerns that impeachment may become a distraction from the primary. Those issues and more will play out Wednesday night when the Democratic Party\u2019s top 10 face off in Atlanta just 75 days before primary voting begins.\nSeven big questions heading into the debate, to be carried on MSNBC:\nWHO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER?\nTurbulent polling across the early voting states has created a murky picture of the top tier of the 2020 class. As much as Joe Biden is still a front-runner, so are Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. The question is who gets the front-runner treatment in Wednesday\u2019s debate. Warren was under near-constant attack last month as a new leader. Will Warren continue to face the heat, or will the ascendant Buttigieg or weakening Biden take more hits?\n___\nHOW WILL OBAMA PLAY?\nFormer President Barack Obama, the most popular Democrat in America, inserted himself into the 2020 primary in recent days by warning candidates against moving too far to the left. His comments create a challenge for Warren and Sanders and an opening for moderates Buttigieg, Biden and Amy Klobuchar to attack. At the same time, Obama\u2019s involvement offers a powerful reminder of the massive role African Americans will play in the presidential nomination process. As we know, all candidates not named Biden have serious work to do when it comes to winning over the black vote. Race and Obama\u2019s legacy could play a major role in shaping the action.\n___\nWHAT SAY YOU, IMPEACHMENT JURY?\nThey have all come out in favor of impeachment \u2014 some more aggressively than others \u2014 but it\u2019s noteworthy that five of the 10 Democrats on stage will serve as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial should the House vote to impeach President Donald Trump. It\u2019s a complicated topic for Democrats. Some senators worry that a prospective impeachment trial will interfere with their ability to court voters early next year. Others fear that impeachment could hurt their party\u2019s more vulnerable candidates in down-ballot elections next year. Either way, what the prospective jurors do or don\u2019t say on the debate stage could be relevant if and when the Senate holds an impeachment trial, which is increasingly likely.\n___\nWILL THEY BASH THE BILLIONAIRES?\nNever before has wealth been under such aggressive attack in a presidential primary election. And with one billionaire onstage and another likely to join the field in the coming days, the billionaire bashing could reach new heights. Tom Steyer has largely gone under the radar, but the even wealthier Michael Bloomberg has generated tremendous buzz as he steps toward a run of his own. Of the two, only Steyer will be on stage, but expect Bloomberg\u2019s shadow in particular to generate passionate arguments about wealth and the role of money in politics.\n___\nWILL SOMEONE STAND UP FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT?\nBiden continues to be the favorite of many establishment Democrats, but his underwhelming candidacy has created an opening for another pragmatic-minded Democrat to step up. That\u2019s why former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Bloomberg are moving into the race. Buttigieg stepped aggressively into the establishment lane in the last debate, but many donors and elected officials remain skeptical of the 37-year-old small-city mayor\u2019s chances. The opportunity is there for lower-tier candidates including Kamala Harris, Klobuchar and Steyer.\n___\nDOES SHE HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT?\nNo single issue has dominated the initial Democratic primary debates more than health care, and it\u2019s safe to assume that will be the case again Wednesday night. And no one has more riding on that specific debate than Warren, who hurt herself last month by stumbling through questions about the cost of her single-payer health care plan. Given that policy specifics make up the backbone of her candidacy, she can\u2019t afford another underwhelming performance on the defining policy debate of the primary season. Expect the policy-minded senator to have a new strategy this time around.\n___\nCAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES?\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew Yang and Steyer are under enormous pressure to break out given their status as the only candidates onstage who haven\u2019t yet qualified for the December debate. They likely won\u2019t have the same number of opportunities to speak as their higher-polling rivals, but these are dire times for the underdogs. They need to do something if they expect to stay relevant in the 2020 conversation.\n___\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \u201cGround Game.\u201d\nMost Popular\n"}, "f6ac15a4d98511396da23e4428deb5605422b1c8bbc8284e771f6896bdccf57f": {"articleBody": "05/10/2018 - Publicado por: Clarissa Borba - Categoria: Sa\u00fade - Tags: sad arrombamento veiculo\nA equipe do Servi\u00e7o de Atendimento Domiciliar (SAD), do bairro Amizade, registrou nesta manh\u00e3 o arrombamento de dois dos cinco autom\u00f3veis da unidade.

Come on.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett , who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions.\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert\u2019s colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections .\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney\u2019s secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure . \u201cOther labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,\u201d Pluznick said.\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove\u00a0home the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to \u201ctaste\u201d and \u201csmell\u201d minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host\u2019s defenses.\nA Job for Tuft Cells\nIn researchers\u2019 assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn\u2019t led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren\u2019t contributing to our sense of taste.\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. \u201cThey were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn\u2019t really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,\u201d said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells\u2019 function, and he eventually got his answer \u2014 through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected \u2014 specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\nHowitt realized that T. muris wasn\u2019t an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice \u2014 something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking for protozoa,\u201d Howitt said. \u201cWe were focused on bacteria.\u201d\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn\u2019t happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\nHowitt\u2019s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body\u2019s defenses \u2014 one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists\u2019 understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett\u2019s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that\u00a0finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\u201cEven textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,\u201d he said.\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature , respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, \u201cpeople just kind of ignored them or didn\u2019t even realize that they were there,\u201d said Megan Baldridge , a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body\u2019s invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system\u2019s maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno , now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen\u2019s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert\u2019s at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs\u2019 recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection, newly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears at right). Tuft cells don\u2019t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to emerge as part of the body\u2019s response against the infection.\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\u201cSure enough, they were all over the place,\u201d Vaughan said. But the tuft cells only appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he and Herbert were \u201cbasically seeing a cell type where [it\u2019s] not supposed to be.\u201d Although he\u2019s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens after the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body\u2019s attempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune response.\nThe researchers don\u2019t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or what they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually \u201ctaste\u201d the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for the body to respond to even minute threats.\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products present in microenvironments within the body. \u201cOnce some of those metabolic products go out of whack \u2026 bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a response if something is wrong.\u201d\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous systems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose tools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell. It isn\u2019t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all evolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of \u201ctaste\u201d receptors on the tongue first, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the order in which it evolved.\u201d\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors\u2019 immune functions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as monocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to detect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed that rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts suggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent receptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of other groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these receptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them for any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft cells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the invaders before they\u2019ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the sudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not always present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\u201cYou may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,\u201d he said. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and asthma: There could be dangers \u201cif you have too many of these cells and they\u2019re too poised to respond to the external environment.\u201d\nCorrection added Nov. 18, 2019: The caption\u00a0below the photograph of Herbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to observe the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice.\nThis article was reprinted on Wired.com .\n"}, "851498a2b9f4f0b578ac9700c245253dbc147a06c0fb3499adebf1c2d5663c29": {"articleBody": "The Dark Enchantment of Carmen Maria Machado\u2019s Memoir, In the Dream House\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford\u2019s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.\nThe Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It\u2019s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford\u2019s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn\u2019t anyone publishing his books?\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford\u2019s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn\u2019t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, \u201cHe was brilliant from the start\u2014reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.\u201d He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly\u2014after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. \u201cWhen you\u2019re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,\u201d said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. \u201cEvery book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.\u201d\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he\u2019s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. \u201cYou\u2019re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that\u2019s out of the water in every novel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it\u2019s too hard for people because he wouldn\u2019t spell things out.\u201d When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he\u2019d respond, \u201cI have a horror of being obvious.\u201d\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what\u2019s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford\u2019s characters often do. If there\u2019s one unifying theme to his books, it\u2019s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.\n\u201cHad he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\u2019ve been George R.R. Martin.\u201d \u2014 Neil Gaiman\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called \u201cAsk Dr. Mike\u201d at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World , the first book in Robert Jordan\u2019s Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV .) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called \u201cWinter Solstice, Camelot Station,\u201d went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here .)\n\u201cHe would make art in the most surprising places,\u201d Gaiman told me. \u201cOnce he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.\u201d When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. \u201cLife was not long enough,\u201d she recalled, \u201cfor Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.\u201d\n\u201cHe could have had a more successful career,\u201d Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa\u2019s husband and Tor\u2019s editor in chief, said, \u201cif he had been more disciplined about his writing\u201d and stuck to one genre, or written a series. \u201cBut Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.\u201d\nNo single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, \u201cHad he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would\u2019ve been George R.R. Martin.\u201d Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels ( The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet? , both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night \u201cshould\u2019ve been marketed like The Name of the Rose . You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.\u2019 \u201d Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin\u2019s, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn\u2019t exactly do Umberto Eco\u2013level business.\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002.\nPhoto by David Dyer-Bennet\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. \u201cAll it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,\u201d Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. \u201cTo be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn\u2019t.\u201d\nTo the extent that Ford\u2019s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor\u2019s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a \u201cgames consultant\u201d for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his \u201cblood brother,\u201d had essentially adopted him.\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford\u2019s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford\u2019s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble . But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford\u2019s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. \u201cMy partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,\u201d Matthesen recalled in an email. \u201cI used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing with Elise bothered\u201d Ford\u2019s family, Starner said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.\u201d But either way, at some point, Ford\u2019s now-deceased father told Starner that \u201cthe only way I know he\u2019s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.\u201d\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as \u201ca magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.\u201d When he\u2019d finish chunks of it, he\u2019d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,\u201d he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:\nIf a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.\nIf he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\nIf he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. \u201cHe looked a little surprised,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cSort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.\u201d Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had \u201cmarried,\u201d but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (\u201cThe Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,\u201d was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford\u2019s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford\u2019s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford\u2019s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford\u2019s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford\u2019s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford\u2019s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford\u2019s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford\u2019s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford\u2019s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion , and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished Aspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford\u2019s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford\u2019s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online ) was that Ford\u2019s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford\u2019s sister, Martha Fry. \u201cI cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,\u201d she said.\nAll contact between Ford\u2019s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was \u201cintroverted by nature.\u201d \u201cI once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,\u201d Dale wrote. \u201cWe went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. \u2026 Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.\u201d Martha added that shortly before their father\u2019s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was \u201ckind and loving.\u201d\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike\u2019s relationship with Elise. \u201cMike\u2019s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,\u201d Dale wrote. \u201cI am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike\u2019s body and calling the police. \u2026 Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as \u2018friend,\u2019 not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.\u201d\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with \u201cthe unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals \u2026 if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike\u2019s commercial affairs.\u201d However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike\u2019s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn\u2019t hear back, they assumed there wasn\u2019t.\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford\u2019s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family\u2019s requests?\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford\u2019s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford\u2019s death, his agent Valerie Smith \u201cwas beginning the process of essentially vanishing\u201d from the industry. She \u201cbecame more and more intermittent\u201d with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone.\u00a0\u00a0Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford\u2019s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978. Web of Angels was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her \u201cpretty overwhelmed,\u201d she said.\u00a0Her heartbreak over Mike Ford\u2019s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. \u201cWhen I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.\u201d Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford\u2019s work.\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford\u2019s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family\u2019s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\nBut I reconnected Ford\u2019s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish\u2014at long last\u2014the unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\nAs in one of John M. Ford\u2019s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It\u2019s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It\u2019s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they\u2019ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford\u2019s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have words, it\u2019s such good news,\u201d she replied in an email. \u201cExcept maybe Mike\u2019s words.\u201d\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I\u2019m going to die. Tell me a story.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. You tell me one, and when you\u2019re gone, I\u2019ll tell it to somebody else.\u201d\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M. Ford\u2019s novel Web of Angels.

Money, too! Because it turns out your don\u2019t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error \u2014 mine, and the people I taught.\nIt\u2019s called Plan & Grow BIG.\nFocus on what really matters in the near future of your business\nPlan & Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\nMaybe you\u2019re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you\u2019ve been trying for years to build a business idea you\u2019ve had in your head \u2014 but it just isn\u2019t living up to what you expected.\nEither way, you\u2019re in the right place because today\u2019s information will help you catapult forward.\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they \u201cneeded\u201d to master.\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads \u2014 before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. \ud83d\ude41\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this \u201conline business thing.\u201d\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.\nTrue confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\nBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\nI\u2019m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their \u201claunch\u201d phases \u2014 they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of time to spare.\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a \u201cpublic figure\u201d than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I\u2019d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I\u2019d need to \u201cput myself out there\u201d on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.\nYikes.\nAnd although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea \u2014 to share my marketing and design training with others \u2014 wasn\u2019t making a single cent.\nWho in their right mind invests in a business idea before they know if it will make money?\nI do, apparently!\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\nBecause I did \u2014 I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time \u2014 an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\nBut I\u2019m glad I did.\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, \u201cThis dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I\u2019m taking this seriously.\u201d\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn\u2019t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took \u2014 on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\nThen another article went live. And another.\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.\nOut with the old, in with the new (and better)\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.\nNow, I\u2019m considered an authority on building an online presence.\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s different in my life now:\nMy business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\nI am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\nMy books are well-received and much loved \u2014 and deliver income to me every single month\nPeople find my website and join my community every day, all year long\nI\u2019m able to travel anywhere I\u2019d like because my business fits in my backpack\nI can \u201cdial up\u201d or \u201cdial back\u201d my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\nHere\u2019s the other important thing \u2026\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business.

Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\nBuild your first offer: Don\u2019t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that\u2019s relatively simple \u2014 but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\nBuild an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\nAnd now \u2026 stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it\u2019s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors\u2019 sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you\u2019re ready to move on \u2026\nThe Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.\nBut growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn\u2019t it?\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that\u2019s perfectly fine. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll focus on while you\u2019re there:\nMake your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great \u2014 but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\nFocus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list \u2014 think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.\nDiscover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!\nBut once you\u2019ve hit on a winning product or service, you\u2019ll be ready for \u2026\nThe Grow Stage: Leverage your success\nIn the GROW stage, you\u2019ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business \u2014 and now you\u2019ll focus on leveraging that success.\nImprove your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what\u2019s working. You\u2019ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\nAdd more revenue streams: As you dial into what\u2019s working well, you may uncover your customers\u2019 unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You\u2019ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you\u2019re able to make some serious investments in your business.\nReady? Set? Business focus!\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID download the quiz , right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you\u2019ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you\u2019re in.\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth \u2014 with less frustration and more confidence because you\u2019re focused on the right thing at the right time.\nThe next BIG challenge is \u2026\nNow that you\u2019re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here\u2019s the next big online business challenge \u2026\nBecoming a \u201cvisible\u201d and public leader in your space.\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\nIn the next article, I\u2019m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you embrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business, you\u2019ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\nYour go-forward plan for business focus\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream into a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and recognition you deserve?\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know what to focus on, and what to ignore.\nOnce you\u2019ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and represent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\nIf you don\u2019t master this, you\u2019ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So how do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\nHow can you step up and embrace the \u201cinternet limelight?\u201d Because once you do, online doors will open for you!\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset .\nPamela Wilsonbigbrandsystem\n"}, "ad826691a8a2f9c4ce50cf0b885af933c4b5119c1f6235cd7df1dfb83f255bcc": {"articleBody": "Monday\u2019s best deals include various MacBook models from $700 at Amazon .

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device.\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front.\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"\u2014and someone he's learned a lot from.\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs.\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company.\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices .\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don\u2019t even own a computer anymore and I don\u2019t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\"\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff.\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader.\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said.\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented.\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\"\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\nRelated Topics:\n"}, "7bb1ca90354313840329d2f569ea9fb3a582df2aa0a5e3669f8fc567eb6ea61b": {"articleBody": "57\n4\nDuck fluff and feathers in the middle of a drying process after being cleaned, in order to be used in duvets and jackets.\nPhoto: Getty Images\nA UK man\u2019s innocent decision to change his bedding caused him to develop a strange, rare condition that left him gasping for air, his doctors say. In a new case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form of allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.\nAccording to the study , published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had suffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he visited his local doctor in November 2016.\nAdvertisement\nAt first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like bronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they worsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his house without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent respiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors, Owen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\u201cTheir immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion\u2014think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama\u201d\nDempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential causes for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had recently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather pillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later confirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.\nThe man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or work closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of \u201c bird fancier\u2019s lung. \u201d But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to feather bedding, it\u2019s instead been dubbed \u201c feather duvet lung. \u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIn some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their feathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion\u2014think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama,\u201d Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.\n"}, "2f42ef1d3ea0c96e56355d3db93d0e06b47e760b74f6f4261278b8cd1c246dd6": {"articleBody": "The Future of Banking Is \u2026 You're Broke\nOur present financial ruin is being turned into a business model.\nEmail\nThe latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the banking sector: They\u2019ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to monetize their brokeness.\nSo-called neo-banks , or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and Australia for the past few years. Now they\u2019re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even\u2014heaven help us\u2014 booyah! . Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\nTheir come-on is that they\u2019re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they\u2019re focused on their customers\u2019 \u201cfinancial health,\u201d as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the \u201cpain\u201d that people feel around their money.\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo\u2013payday loan\u2014your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\nThese neo-banks aren\u2019t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they\u2019re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they\u2019re cutting into millennials\u2019 ability to buy homes , have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you\u2019re likely to have .\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\nBetter banking isn\u2019t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There\u2019s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees , routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it\u2019s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.\nStill, it\u2019s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives, founders, and industry veterans, as I did at October\u2019s Money 20/20 conference , and hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of money will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next generation are as fragile as a Faberg\u00e9 egg. This, according to attendees and speakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation\u2019s finances isn\u2019t technology\u2019s problem to solve.\nAdvertisement\nIn fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a more convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little like the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of work could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.\nNo one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation\u2019s finances isn\u2019t technology\u2019s problem to solve.\nThe same business logic\u2014that you\u2019re trapped in a sad, hellish existence dictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the Matrix\u2014underlies the entire gig economy. It\u2019s the basis for another tech veneer, this one layered over people\u2019s inability to find meaningful work for reasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber Money. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery people, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.\nIn fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how the latest wave of banking disruption might play out.\nThere was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber \u201cside hustle\u201d commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber or Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on Airbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather than a necessity . Remember when this was about making \u201cextra\u201d money, instead of just barely enough?\nIt was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made these things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber and Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses could be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of independent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash, GrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.\nThis phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for enough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked under the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of retirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of apps\u2014the neo-banks\u2014were deployed amid the chaos.\nI\u2019d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for financial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems plausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or online chat could make us happy. Let\u2019s not forget, many people really hate big banks and would rather take their business elsewhere.\nBut there are two problems with this potential disruption.\nOne, it might not end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber and Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and they\u2019re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of the driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is both inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and incentives.\nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\nThat will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won\u2019t lie down and let the disruption happen\u2014they\u2019ll almost certainly buy some of these upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are already honing in on the space. Apple\u2019s ( issue-laden ) credit card, Amazon\u2019s small business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google\u2019s forthcoming consumer checking accounts , and Facebook\u2019s payment wallets could all eat into the market for new companies.\nWhether it\u2019s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech companies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving consumers stranded. That\u2019s pretty disruptive when you\u2019re talking about your checking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more money, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.\nA second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design, accessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying problems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank can erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the unexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America\u2019s existential brokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they\u2019ll ease your pain, but that\u2019s just morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness, you\u2019re still on your own.\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n"}, "624fcd903d56fc7055fa7097b330629450c095ad6937318deb027be7803bbf35": {"articleBody": "World\nHong Kong chaos: China deploys troops and warns SURRENDER is only option\nCHINA has sent troops to Hong Kong in a bid to restore order following the months of violent riots, warnings it will not allow the city to spiral into chaos.\nPUBLISHED: 10:48, Tue, Nov 19, 2019\n| UPDATED: 11:05, Tue, Nov 19, 2019\n0\nThis comes after police said the demonstrators inside the Polytechnic University in Hong Kong had no option but to come out and surrender.

Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see \u201d Mayer said.\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney\u2019s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered  its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney\u2019s  flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\nAdvertisement\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game.\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\u201cWe will see the industry shake out a bit,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cNot everyone will succeed.\u201d\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services  consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\u201cThere will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cWe want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.\u201d\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer\u2019s mettle.

Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban\u2019s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group\u2019s Haqqani network.\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages \u201cgive[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\u201cWe see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.\u201d\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. \u201cWe pray for the full recovery of both men,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. \u201cWe thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.\u201d\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week , he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\nHe also said he hoped the swap would \u201cpave the way\u201d for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, \u201cWe are profoundly pleased and relieved\u201d at the hostages\u2019 release, adding that Weeks\u2019 family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016.

It\u2019s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I\u2019m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn\u2019t want to spend it. He\u2019s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I\u2019m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he\u2019ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we\u2019ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies\u2019 room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don\u2019t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn\u2019t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her \u201csister\u201d didn\u2019t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn\u2019t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I\u2019m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn\u2019t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don\u2019t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

For this years\u2019 edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme \u2018The Medium is the Message\u2019. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition \u2013 in the historical center of Amsterdam \u2013 which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\nCover image: artist\u2019s impression of the lighting installation by\u00a0Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\nIvana Jeli\u0107 and Pavle Petrovi\u0107 (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh\u2019s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) \u2013 also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua \u2013 explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio\u2019s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli, Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years\u2019 exhibition revolves around the theme \u2018The Medium is the Message\u2018, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible?

He didn\u2019t get it.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor\u2019s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\u201cGovernor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!\u201d Trump tweeted before Election Day. \u201cMatt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!\u201d\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. \u201cVirginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,\u201d he said .\n\u201cThe people of this country aren\u2019t buying\u201d impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. \u201cYou see it because we\u2019re going up and they\u2019re going down.\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta give me a big win please,\u201d he said later. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points . Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory \u2014 their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago , when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats didn\u2019t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear \u2014 whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state \u2014 promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president\u2019s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president\u2019s immediate political fortunes.\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.\u201d And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense \u2014 Trump\u2019s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival \u2014 was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he \u201ccommitted impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.\u201d\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication \u2014 proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president\u2019s wrongdoing.\nBut it\u2019s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table \u2014 that there\u2019s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president\u2019s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn\u2019t be fishing expeditions \u2014 given the president\u2019s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there\u2019s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas \u2014 but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn\u2019t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)\nI don\u2019t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell\u2019s hands until there\u2019s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there\u2019s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what\u2019s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Now we are in a good position to advance.\"\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight hours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court. Spain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia. Russia beat Croatia on Monday.\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a position that you don\u2019t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match, we were under pressure.\"\nSerbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic and Britain\u2019s Andy Murray will make their first appearance on Wednesday.

This was a really difficult tie.\"\nARGENTINA CRUISES\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\"It\u2019s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios\u2019 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur\u2019s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\nMore from Sportsnet\n"}, "bc13ff87b2630ffbebc33bc37b11178b14f03109055e1d17bf644f804b63d98a": {"articleBody": "Linkedin\nMajor WeWork layoffs to begin today\n\u201cWe have to make some necessary job eliminations,\u201d WeWork chairman Marcelo Claure said in an email to employees Monday\nTRD NATIONAL /\nBy David Jeans\nMore than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in coming weeks (Credit: iStock)\nMore than a third of WeWork\u2019s 12,000 employees will likely receive notice this week that they no longer have a job.

The group, WeWorkers Coalition, formed in recent weeks and sent a letter to management earlier this month stating that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be defined by the scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the company\u2019s leadership.\u201d\nThe group announced over the weekend that WeWork had reached an agreement with JLL to accept close to 1,000 maintenance and cleaning workers, many of whom would then be contracted to work in WeWork buildings.\nHowever, the group raised alarm at the terms of the deal, and said that employees were told by WeWork to sign the terms of the contract by Monday, otherwise it would consider their resignations voluntary. The group said on Twitter that the contract has confused employees with pay discrepancies, and demanded a deadline extension.\nIn a separate tweet, the group added that WeWork \u201cis not following through on its promise to treat employees with \u2018dignity and respect\u2019 during this restructuring process.\u201d\nMany employees and shareholders with stock options are also waiting to hear when a $3 billion tender offer by SoftBank will be launched, after being delayed for almost two weeks.\n"}, "8cad00dc22de45ba42e9540421b5f78333f7ac57b385d69acb27a53b9fd69f0c": {"articleBody": "@noksutagram <The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu>\u00a0\u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019 Performance\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance\n<The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu>\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance [The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu] \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019\nThe refreshing autumn sky!\nThis is Daehak-ro Marronnier Park where the air is filled with the scent of fall~\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance [The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu] \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019\nThe reason we came to Marronnier Park!\nIt\u2019s because <The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu> was part of the opening ceremony of \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019 which will be held until October 31st 2018!\nShall we go back in time to visit the actual scene of the festival?\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance [The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu] \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019\nThe opening ceremony of \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019 was held on a special stage at Marronnier Park!!\nPreparation work is still ongoing and it\u2019s 6PM, before the start of the performance!\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance [The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu] \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019\nCrowds of people came to the actual scene of the opening ceremony!\nFor this opening ceremony, Jeongdong Theater prepared three items under the title of our traditional performance <The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu>!\nOne of the items was the beautiful Hwajeontae Dance performed along with graceful Korean tunes, followed by the Coloured Box Drum Dance with the cheerful rhythm of drums and the Pangut that matches the exciting rhythms of the drum!\n2018 Jeongdong Theater Tradition Series Performance [The Palace: Tale of Jang Noksu] \u20182018 Welcome Daehak-ro Festival\u2019\nOur team, made up of\u00a0Nam Yongwoo, Lee Gisoo, Lee Jungdae from the percussion team and Kim Hana, Kim Hyesu, Kim Minjeong from the training team of Jeongdong Theater, prepared an\u00a0outstanding performance at the festival!
